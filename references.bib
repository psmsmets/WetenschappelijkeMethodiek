abstract = {[1] Unprecedented hydroacoustic observations of the megathrust earthquake of 26 Dec, 2004 were afforded by a network of 5 small hydroacoustic arrays located in the Indian Ocean, at distances of 2800 to 7000 km from the epicenter. Each array recorded acoustic waves, called T waves, generated by this event. Analysis of a series of short time windows within the T wave coda shows that the receiver to source azimuth varies smoothly as a function of time, indicating that the apparent T wave source is not stationary. The apparent T wave source moves northward along the Sunda trench at an average velocity of 2 km/s, closely tracking event rupture. The hydroacoustic data suggest that the rupture proceeded in two distinct phases; initially it progressed northwest along the Sunda trench with a velocity of approximately 2.4 km/s. At 600 km from the epicenter the rupture slowed to approximately 1.5 km/s, as it continued to propagate to the northwest.},

@article{Candel1977,
abstract = {The propagation of waves in slightly inhomogeneousdispersive media is conveniently described by a geometrical or kinematic theory. In such frameworks the solution of the propagation problem is constructed by (a)deriving a dispersion relation and determining its characteristic lines and (b) solving an equation expressing the con- servation of a field invariant like the wave action. This paper is concerned with the implementation of the last step under general field and boundary conditions. The method presented is based on the derivation of a variational system of differential equations for the geodesic elements of the wave front. The elementary cross-sectionof the wave front is obtained by integration and the principle of conservation of the field invariant directly yields the field amplitude. In addition, suitable jump con- ditions are derived for treating specular reflexions a t solid boundaries. The method is illustrated by specificproblems of interest in aeroacoustics.},

abstract = {This study describes a method for determining the statistical confidence in estimates of direction-of-arrival and trace velocity stemming from signals present in atmospheric infrasound data. It is assumed that the signal source is far enough removed from the infrasound sensor array that a plane-wave approximation holds, and that multipath and multiple source effects are not present. Propagation path and medium inhomogeneities are assumed not to be known at the time of signal detection, but the ensemble of time delays of signal arrivals between array sensor pairs is estimable and corrupted by uncorrelated Gaussian noise. The method results in a set of practical uncertainties that lend themselves to a geometric interpretation. Although quite general, this method is intended for use by analysts interpreting data from atmospheric acoustic arrays, or those interested in designing and deploying them. The method is applied to infrasound arrays typical of those deployed as a part of the International Monitoring System of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization.},

Measurements of power spectral density at 100 Hz from four of these bottom mounted hydrophones are presented, along with AIS data and shipping and trade statistics to assess to what extent the eco- nomic impact of COVID-19 can be observed acoustically and in near real-time.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The previously reported observation of anomalous eastward gravity wave forcing at mesopause heights around the onset of the January 2013 major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) over Trondheim, Norway (63° N, 10° E), is placed in a global perspective using Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) temperature observations from the Aura satellite. It is shown that this anomalous forcing results in a clear cooling over Trondheim about 10 km below mesopause heights. Conversely, near the mesopause itself, where the gravity wave forcing was measured, observations with meteor radar, OH airglow and MLS show no distinct cooling. Polar cap zonal mean temperatures show a similar vertical profile. Longitudinal variability in the high northern-latitude mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) is characterized by a quasi-stationary wave-1 structure, which reverses phase at altitudes below {\~{}} 0.1 hPa. This wave-1 develops prior to the SSW onset, and starts to propagate westward at the SSW onset. The latitudinal pole-to-pole temperature structure associated with the major SSW shows a warming (cooling) in the winter stratosphere (mesosphere) which extends to about 40° N. In the stratosphere, a cooling extending over the equator and far into the summer hemisphere is observed, whereas in the mesosphere an equatorial warming is noted. In the Southern Hemisphere mesosphere, a warm anomaly overlaying a cold anomaly is present, which is shown to propagate downward in time. This observed structure is in accordance with the temperature perturbations predicted by the proposed interhemispheric coupling mechanism for cases of increased winter stratospheric planetary wave activity, of which major SSWs are an extreme case. These results provide observational evidence for the interhemispheric coupling mechanism, and for the wave-mean flow interaction believed to be responsible for the establishment of the anomalies in the summer hemisphere.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The high sample rate revealed that in addition to the known initial infrasound, the acoustic signal includes an energetic high-frequency (typically {\textgreater}100 Hz) coda. This audible signal starts before the positive infrasound onset goes negative. We suggest that the infrasonic onset is due to magma doming at the free surface, whereas the immediate high-frequency signal reflects the following explosivedischarge flow.During strong gas-rich eruptions, positively skewed shockwave-like components with sharp compression and gradual depression appeared. We suggest that successive bursting of overpressurized small bubbles and the resultant volcanic jets sustain the highly gas-rich explosions and emit the audible sound. When the jet is supersonic, microexplosions of ambient air entrained in the hot jet emit the skewed waveforms},

It is found that microseisms arriving from the southeast and northwest consist almost entirely of Rayleigh waves, while microseisms from the northeast and southwest have significant Love wave energy. The Love waves appear to be generated in the same source region as the Rayleigh waves. To account for the variation in Love wave energy as a function of source direction, the geologic structure along the various propagation paths is reviewed, and it is found that Love waves appear to be inhibited when propagating across the discontinuity surface between ocean and continental crust and when propagating across continental shield regions, both obstacles to a continuous surface layer. Observations from around the world are discussed, and we show that these two generalities appear to account for many of the reported discrepancies in microseism composition.},

The ensembles of perturbed analyses, provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), include error variances of both model and assimilated observations. Ensemble spread profiles indicate a yearly mean effective sound speed variation of up to 8 ms−1 in the stratosphere, exceeding occasionally 25 ms−1 for a single ensemble set. It is shown that errors in point estimates of effective sound speed are dominated by variations in wind strength and direction. One year of large mining explosions in the Aitik mine, northern Sweden, observed at infrasound array IS37 in northern Norway are simulated using 3-D ray tracing. Probabilistic propagation modeling using the ensembles demonstrates that small-scale fluctuations are not always necessary to improve the match between predictions and observations.},

abstract = {The importance of horizontal and vertical advection of temperature for the Antarctic major stratospheric warming in September 2002 has been investigated, by applying the thermodynamic energy equation to ECMWF temperature and wind data. The analysis, which is carried out for the one-week period 19-26 September, shows that the large temperature increase in this period in the polar stratosphere is mainly due to horizontal advection of temperature. In addition, it has been investigated to what extent the observed temperature increase, as well as the change in the zonal wind, can be simulated with a simple conceptual model of a moving polar vortex. The model consists of a horizontal, circular vortex whose centre moves with constant meridional velocity off from the South Pole. The temperature and zonal wind fields are prescribed, stationary and zonally symmetric (relative to the vortex centre). Despite its simplicity, the model simulates several important aspects of the observations, such as the zonal-mean temperature increase and zonal-mean zonal wind reversal poleward of 60 degrees S, and the zonal-mean temperature decrease at middle latitudes.},

abstract = {A model of anisotropic fluctuations forming in wind velocity and air temperature in a stably stratified atmosphere is described. The formation mechanism of these fluctuations is associated with the cascade transport of energy from sources of atmospheric gravity waves to wave disturbances with shorter vertical scales (than the scales of the initial disturbances generated by the sources) and, at the same time, with longer horizontal scales. This model is used to take into account the effects of infrasonic-wave scattering from anisotropic inhomogeneities of the effective sound speed in the atmosphere. Experimental data on the stratospheric, mesospheric, and thermospheric arrivals of signals (generated by explosion sources such as surface explosions and volcanoes) in the zones of acoustic shadow are interpreted on the basis of the results of calculations of the scattered infrasonic field in the context of the parabolic equation. The signals calculated with consideration for the fine structure of wind velocity and air temperature are compared with the signals observed in a shadow zone. The possibility to acoustically sound this structure at heights of both the middle and upper atmospheres is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract = {Wind noise is a significant problem for infrasound detection and localization systems. Pipe arrays are commonly used for suppressing wind noise by area averaging the relatively incoherent wind noise. The area averaging and physical construction of the pipe arrays limit the ability of the array to measure infrasound pulses with waveform fidelity. The need for waveform fidelity is motivated by the recent increase in the ability to predict waveforms theoretically from the meteorology data. This chapter investigates large cylindrical and hemispherical porous windscreens, which employ single-point sensors with little or no waveform distortion. The theory of wind noise generation is briefly outlined to provide a basis for understanding the windscreen research. Next, four recent experiments measuring the wind noise reduction of porous cylindrical screens with respect to bare sensors mounted flush with the ground, the wind noise reduction of porous fabric domes with respect to a sensor sitting on the ground surface, the wind noise reduction of porous metal domes with respect to other sensors, and the wind noise reduction of porous cylinders and fabric domes with respect to flush-mounted sensors and each other. The second and third experiments also demonstrate the ability of the windscreens to record impulses with waveform fidelity. The largest screens provide up to 20 dB of wind noise reduction down to wavenumbers on the order of the inverse of the height of the windscreen. A theory of wind noise reduction is developed and leads to a better understanding of the relative contribution of wind noise generated at the surface of the screen and wind noise generated by flow through the screen. It is concluded that construction of domes large enough to provide signal enhancement down to 0.1 Hz is feasible and would provide high fidelity time waveforms for comparison with theoretical predictions.},

@article{Woollings2010,
abstract = {There is widely believed to be a link between stratospheric flow variability and stationary, persistent ” blocking” weather systems, but the precise nature of this link has proved elusive. Using data from the ERA-40 Reanalysis and an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) with a well-resolved stratosphere (HadGAM), it is shown that there are in fact several different highly significant associations, with blocking in different regions being related to different patterns of stratospheric variability. This is true in both hemispheres and in both data sets. The associations in HadGAM are shown to be very similar to those in ERA-40, although the model has a tendency to underestimate both European blocking and the wave number 2 stratospheric variability to which this is related. Although the focus is on stratospheric variability in general, several of the blocking links are seen to occur in association with the major stratospheric sudden warmings. In general, the direction of influence appears to be upward, as blocking anomalies are shown to modify the planetary stationary waves, leading to an upward propagation of wave activity into the stratosphere. However, significant correlations are also apparent with the zonal mean flow in the stratosphere leading the occurrence of blocking at high latitudes. Finally, the underestimation of blocking is an enduring problem in GCMs, and an example has recently been given in which improving the resolution of the stratosphere improved the representation of blocking. Here, however, another example is given, in which increasing the stratospheric resolution unfortunately does not lead to an improvement in blocking.},

abstract = {Microseisms in the period of 2–10 s are generated in deep oceans and near coastal regions. It is common for microseisms from multiple sources to arrive at the same time at a given seismometer. It is therefore desirable to be able to measure multiple slowness vectors accurately. Popular ways to estimate the direction of arrival of ocean induced microseisms are the conventional (fk) or adaptive (Capon) beamformer. These techniques give robust estimates, but are limited in their resolution capabilities and hence do not always detect all arrivals. One of the limiting factors in determining direction of arrival with seismic arrays is the array response, which can strongly influence the estimation of weaker sources. In this work, we aim to improve the resolution for weaker sources and evaluate the performance of two deconvolution algorithms, Richardson–Lucy deconvolution and a new implementation of CLEAN-PSF. The algorithms are tested with three arrays of different aperture (ASAR, WRA and NORSAR) using 1 month of real data each and compared with the conventional approaches. We find an improvement over conventional methods from both algorithms and the best performance with CLEAN-PSF. We then extend the CLEAN-PSF framework to three components (3C) and evaluate 1 yr of data from the Pilbara Seismic Array in northwest Australia. The 3C CLEAN-PSF analysis is capable in resolving a previously undetected Sn phase.},

abstract = {Low-frequency variability and trends in temperature from 1979 to 2012 are examined. Observational improvements are noted and near-surface behaviour of the ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis is reviewed. Attention is then focussed on how closely ERA-Interim fits the upper-air data it assimilates, the bias adjustments it infers for satellite data, and its agreement with the ERA-40, MERRA and JRA-55 reanalyses and with model simulations. Global-mean fits to independently homogenised radiosonde temperatures and variationally adjusted satellite brightness temperatures are mainly within 0.1 K in the troposphere, with some degradation over time from assimilating varying amounts of aircraft and rain-affected microwave-radiance data, and from a change in source of sea-surface-temperature analysis. Lower-tropospheric warming appears to be somewhat underestimated. Temperature variations in the tropical upper troposphere correlate well with those at the surface, but amplitude is more than doubled, in agreement with modelling. Specific humidity varies in concert; relative humidity is largely uniform, but dips during El Ni{\~{n}}o events. Agreement with the other reanalyses is particularly close in the lower stratosphere, where radiance data and the background model constrain cooling to be slightly slower than in the homogenised radiosonde data. Perturbations to global-mean temperatures from underestimating warming following the El Chich{\'{o}}n and Pinatubo volcanic eruptions and from assimilating recent GPSRO data are at most 0.2 K, less than 20{\%} of the net change since 1979 at 50 hPa. Middle-stratospheric variations are more uncertain. Recent cooling appears to be underestimated by assimilating increasing amounts of unadjusted radiosonde data, but results do not support a recent reprocessing of earlier sounding data that suggests stronger middle-stratospheric cooling than previously indicated. Strong analysed upper-stratospheric cooling agrees quite well with model simulations if occasional jumps due to unadjusted bias changes in high-sounding satellite data are discounted. Producing ERA-Interim in two separate streams caused only minor discontinuities where streams join at the start of 1989.},

abstract = {Synoptic, coarse-grain, isentropic maps of Ertel's potential vorticity Q for the northern middle stratosphere, estimated using a large-Richardson-number approximation, are presented for a number of days in January–February 1979, together with some related isentropic trajectory calculations The effects of substituting FGGE for NMC base data are noted, as well as some slight corrections to maps published earlier. The combined evidence from the observations and from dynamical models strongly indicates the existence of planetary-wave breaking, a process in which material contours are rapidly and irreversibly deformed. In the winter stratosphere this occurs most spectacularly in a gigantic 'nonlinear critical layer', or 'surf zone', which surrounds the main polar vortex, and which tends to erode the vortex when wave amplitudes become large. Some of the FGGE-based Q maps suggest that we may be seeing glimpses of local dynamical instabilities and vortex-rollup phenomena within breaking planetary waves. Related phenomena in the troposphere are discussed. An objective definition of the area A(t) of the main vortex, as it appears on isentropic Q maps, is proposed. A smoothed time series of daily values of A(t) should be a statistically powerful 'circulation index' for the state of the winter-time middle stratosphere, which avoids the loss of information incurred by Eulerian space and time averaging.},

abstract = {We use both regional and local infrasound data to investigate the dynamics of the 2012-2013 eruption of Tolbachik Volcano, Kamchatka, Russia during select periods of time. Analysis of regional data recorded at the IMS array IS44 in southern Kamchatka, {\~{}} 384 km from the vent focuses on the eruption onset in November 2012, while analysis of local data focuses on activity in February and August 2013. Signals recorded from Tolbachik suggest a change in eruptive intensity possibly occurred from November 27-30, 2012. Local infrasound data recorded at distances of 100-950 m from the vent are characterized primarily by repeated, transient explosion signals indicative of gas slug bursts. Three methods are employed to pick slug burst events in February and August. The nature of slug bursts makes a monopole acoustic source model particularly fitting, permitting volume outflux and slug radius calculations for individual events. Volume outfluxes and slug radii distributions provide three possible explanations for the eruption style of Tolbachik Volcano from mid-February to late August. Cumulative outflux for slug bursts (i.e. mass of emissions from individual bursts) derived by infrasound for both February and August range from {\textless} 100 to {\~{}} 3000 kg. These values are greater than infrasound-derived emissions calculated at Pacaya Volcano, but less than those calculated at Mt. Erebus Volcano. From this, we determine slug bursts at Tolbachik Volcano in February and August were larger on average than those at Pacaya Volcano in 2010, but smaller on average than those at Mt. Erebus in 2008. Our overall emissions estimates are in general agreement with estimates from satellite observations. This agreement supports the monopole source inversion as a potential method for estimating mass of emissions from slug burst events.},

So motivated, seismologists have evaluated apparent seismic travel times in correlations of ambient seismic noise and tomographically constructed impressive maps of seismic wave velocity. Inasmuch as the random seismic waves used in these evaluations are usually not fully equipartitioned, it seems right to ask why it works so well, or even if the results are trustworthy. The error, in apparent travel time, due to non-isotropic specific intensity is evaluated here in a limit of large receiver-receiver separation and for the case in which the source of the noise is in the far field of both receivers. It is shown that the effect is small, even for cases in which one might have considered the anisotropy to be significant, and even fo...},

abstract = {In seismology, coda wave interferometry (CWI) is an effective tool to monitor time-lapse changes using later arriving, multiply scattered coda waves. Typically, CWI relies on an esti- mate of themedium's impulse response. The latter is retrieved through simple time-averaging of receiver-receiver cross-correlations of the ambient field, that is, seismic interferometry (SI). In general, the coda is induced by heterogeneities in the Earth. Being comparatively homoge- neous, however, ice bodies such as glaciers and ice sheets exhibit little scattering. In addition, the temporal stability of the time-averaged cross-correlations suffers from temporal variations in the distribution and amplitude of the passive seismic sources. Consequently, application of CWI to ice bodies is currently limited. Nevertheless, fracturing and changes in the englacial macroscopic water content alter the bulk elastic properties of ice bodies, which can be mon- itored with cryoseismological measurements. To overcome the current limited applicability of CWI to ice bodies, we therefore introduce virtual-reflector seismology (VRS). VRS relies on a so-called multidimensional deconvolution (MDD) process of the time-averaged cross- correlations. The technique results in the retrieval of a medium response that includes virtual reflections from a contour of receivers enclosing the region of interest (i.e. the region to be monitored). The virtual reflections can be interpreted as artificial coda replacing the (lacking) natural scattered coda. Hence, this artificial coda might be exploited for the purpose of CWI. From an implementation point of view, VRS is similar to SI by MDD, which, as its name suggests, also relies on a multidimensional deconvolution process. SI byMDD, however, does not generate additional virtual reflections. Advantageously, both techniques mitigate spurious coda changes associated with temporal variations in the distribution and amplitude of the passive seismic sources. In this work, we apply SI by MDD and VRS to synthetic and active seismic surface-wave data. The active seismic data were acquired on Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Switzerland. We successfully retrieve virtual reflections through the application of VRS to this active seismic data. In application to both synthetic and active seismic data, we showthe potential ofVRS to monitor time-lapse changes. In addition,we find that SI byMDD allows for a more accurate determination of phase velocity.},

abstract = {Abstract. This paper presents a novel solver for the eikonal equation that is designed to run efficiently on massively parallel systems. The proposed method manages a list of active nodes and iteratively updates the solutions on those grid points until they converge. The management of the list does not entail the extra burden of ordered data structures. The proposed method has suboptimal worst-case performance, but in practice, on real and synthetic datasets, it performs fewer computations per node than optimal alternatives. Furthermore, the proposed method uses local, synchronous updates and therefore has better cache coherency, is simple to implement, and scales efficiently on parallel architectures, e.g., multiprocessor systems or GPUs (graphics processing units). The paper describes the method, the implementation on the GPU, and performance analysis that compares against the state-of-the-art eikonal solvers. 1. Introduction.

For a given launch angle along a specified azimuth, the ray parameter is redefined to include the influence of the horizontal wind component along the direction of wave propagation. Under the assumption of negligible horizontal wind shear, the horizontal wind component transverse to the ray propagation does not affect the direction of the wave normal, but displaces the reference frame of the moving wavefront, thus altering the observed incidence azimuth. Expressions are derived for the time, horizontal range, and transvers range of the arriving waves as a function of ray parameter. Algorithms for the location of infrasonic wave sources using the modified tau-pM formulation in conjucntion with regional atmospheric wind and temperature data are discussed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Authors 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal Astronomical Society. Obtaining new seismic responses from existing recordings is generally referred to as seismic interferometry (SI). Conventionally, the SI responses are retrieved by simple crosscorrelation of recordings made by separate receivers: one of the receivers acts as a 'virtual source' whose response is retrieved at the other receivers.When SI is applied to recordings of ambient seismic noise, mostly surface waves are retrieved. The newly retrieved surface wave responses can be used to extract receiver-receiver phase velocities. These phase velocities often serve as input parameters for tomographic inverse problems. Another application of SI exploits the temporal stability of the multiply scattered arrivals of the newly retrieved surface wave responses. Temporal variations in the stability and/or arrival time of these multiply scattered arrivals can often be linked to temporally varying parameters such as hydrocarbon production and precipitation. For all applications, however, the accuracy of the retrieved responses is paramount. Correct response retrieval relie s on a uniform illumination of the receivers: irregularities in the illumination pattern degrade the accuracy of the newly retrieved responses. In practice, the illumination pattern is often far from uniform. In that case, simple crosscorrelation of separate receiver recordings only yields an estimate of the actual, correct virtual-source response. Reformulating the theory underlying SI by crosscorrelation as a multidimensional deconvolution (MDD) process, allows this estimate to be improved. SI by MDD corrects for the non-uniform illumination pattern by means of a so-called point-spread function (PSF), which captures the irregularities in the illumination pattern. Deconvolution by this PSF removes the imprint of the irregularities on the responses obtained through simple crosscorrelation. We apply SI by MDD to surface wave data recorded by the Malarg{\"{u}}e seismic array in western Argentina. The aperture of the array is approximately 60 km and it is located on a plateau just east of the Andean mountain range. The array has a T-shape: the receivers along one of the two lines act as virtual sources whose responses are recorded by the receivers along the other (perpendicular) line. We select time windows dominated by surface wave noise travelling in a favourable direction, that is, traversing the line of virtual sources before arriving at the receivers at which we aim to retrieve the virtual-source responses. These time windows are selected through a frequency-dependent slowness analysis along the two receiver lines. From the selected time windows, estimates of virtual-source responses are retrieved by means of crosscorrelations. Similarly, crosscorrelations between the positions of the virtual sources are computed to build the PSF. We use the PSF to deconvolve the effect of illumination irregularities and the source function from the virtual-source responses retrieved by crosscorrelation. The combined effect of time-window selection and MDD results in more accurate and temporally stable surface wave responses.},

abstract = {My father, an attorney, often commented on the dynamics of legal contests: "Moregood stories are ruined by an eyewitness⋯." Over the last 40 years of oceanography to which I have been witness, a similar principle has held. Theory has explained why, and models have simulated, but most of the steps in knowledge have been closely tied to observations. In part, as Walter Munk has often said, this is because "Every time we look at the ocean in a different way we learn something new." Today, those interested in the large-scale structure and variability of the world's oceans are blessed with an amazing array of observations with which to work. Satellites provide the most voluminous ocean data with global coverage and have supported some of the most significant increments in understanding the ocean; the first SST images made vivid the different patterns of turbulence in different regions; today altimetry and scatterometry describe evolving dynamically important fields. Over the last half-century a complementary global in situ observing system has been developed and I have been fortunate to observe some of that development. I would like to tell what I know of its story. The capabilities of the emerging global ocean observing system have been widely described (see Koblinsky and Smith, 2001) and results from the more mature elements have already had important impacts on ocean science. Baker (1981) gives a wonderfully comprehensive, if dated, review of ocean observing instruments while Gould (2005) tells the story of subsurface floats from start to the present. McPhaden et al. (1998) describes the development of the tropical Pacific's Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) observing system and McPhaden discusses it in this volume. To complement these, I focus on some of the ideas, people, and institutions that I think made progress possible.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Matsuno1971a,
abstract = {Abstract The dynamics of the stratosphere sudden warming phenomenon is discussed in terms of the interaction of vertically propagating planetary waves with zonal winds. If global-scale disturbances are generated in the troposphere, they propagate upward into the stratosphere, where the waves act to decelerate the polar night jet through the induction of a meridional circulation. Thus, the distortion and the break-down of the polar vortex occur. If the disturbance is intense and persists, the westerly jet may eventually disappear and an easterly wind may replace it. Then “critical layer interaction” takes place. Further intensification of the easterly wind and rapid warming of the polar air are expected to occur as well as weakening of the disturbance. The model is verified by numerical integrations of the adiabatic-geostrophic potential vorticity equation. Computed results possess features similar to those observed in sudden warming phenomena.},

abstract = {We propose a numerical modeling technique based on a frequency-dependent attenuation relation to assess, quantify and optimize the performance of any arbitrary infrasound network to monitor explosive sources such as volcanic eruptions. Simulations are further enhanced by including realistic sources and propagation effects. We apply our approach to both hemispheres by considering the Euro-Mediterranean and the Eastern Australian regions. In these regions, we use quasi-permanent infrasound signals from Mt. Etna recorded in Tunisia and from Mt. Yasur recorded in New Caledonia. These well-instrumented volcanoes offer a unique opportunity to validate our attenuation model. In particular, accurate comparisons between near- and far-field recordings demonstrate the potential of the proposed methodology to remotely monitor volcanoes. A good agreement is found between modeled and observed results, especially when incorporating representative 10 m s−1 wind perturbations in the atmospheric specifications according to previous campaign measurements. To optimize the network layout in order to ensure the best monitoring of the volcanoes, we proceed through a grid search to find optimum locations of an additional array. We show that adding one array at an appropriate location in both regions under study could significantly improve detections half of the year. The application of the proposed methodology can provide in near real-time a realistic confidence level of volcanic eruption detections, useful to mitigate the risk of aircrafts encountering volcanic ash.},

abstract = {An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been implemented at the Canadian Meteorological Centre to provide an ensemble of initial conditions for the medium-range ensemble prediction system. This demonstrates that the EnKF can be used for operational atmospheric data assimilation. We show how the EnKF relates to the Kalman filter. In particular, to make the ensemble approximation feasible, we have to use a fairly small ensemble with many less members than either the number of model coordinates, or the number of independent observations, or the (unknown) dimension of the dynamical system. To nevertheless obtain good results, we must (i) counter the tendency of the ensemble spread to underestimate the true error, and (ii) localize the ensemble covariances. The localization is severe and leads to imbalance in the initial conditions. The operational EnKF is used to investigate to what extent our system respects the underlying hypotheses of both the Kalman filter and its ensemble approximation. In particular, we quantify the imbalance in the initial conditions and the magnitude of the model-error component. The occurrence of imbalance constrains the ways in which time interpolation can be performed and in which parametrized model error can be added. With this study we hope to obtain and provide guidance for further improvements to the EnKF. Copyright 2005 Royal Meteorological Society},

The CEA/DASE has in charge the installation and maintenance of a number of these stations as well as the development of data processing methods for operational infrasound monitoring. Due to the lack of data in the middle and upper atmosphere ($\backslash${\textgreater}50 km), there is a growing interest in infrasound measurements as a remote sensing technology for atmospheric sounding. Various simulation studies show the relevance of infrasound data for validating standard atmospheric models, and most of them point the limits of these models to explain the large variability observed in infrasound data. Systematic biases are observed between simulations and observations, especially during the seasonal transitions and at smaller time scale (days), due to meteorological effects. They are the manifestations of atmospheric variations not included in the models. Our studies deal with the development of inversion methods of infrasound data in order to retrieve some meteorological parameters of the atmosphere such as wind velocity or temperature profiles. We present a methodology for infrasound data inversion, regularization methods of the inverse problem and preliminary results from synthetic data.},

Intervariable dependence structure (e.g., between different quantities like temperature and precipitation or between sites) is typically ignored, which can have an impact on subsequent calculations that depend on multiple climate variables. A novel multivariate bias correction (MBC) algorithm is introduced as a multidimensional analog of univariate quantile mapping. Two variants are presented. MBCp and MBCr respectively correct Pearson correlation and Spearman rank correlation dependence structure, with marginal distributions in both constrained to match observed distributions via quantile mapping.

Infrasound is routinely observed at infrasound arrays from the International Mon-itoring System, in place for the verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Association and source identification are key elements of the verification system. The moving nature of a rocket is a defining criterion, in order to distinguish it from an isolated explosion. Here, it is shown how infrasound recordings can be associated, which leads to identification of the rocket. Propagation modeling is included to further constrain the source identification. Four rocket launches by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 2009 and 2017 are analyzed, in which multiple arrays detected the infrasound. Source identification in this region is impor-tant for verification purposes. It is concluded that with a passive monitoring technique such as infrasound, characteristics can be remotely obtained on sources of interest, i.e., infrasonic intelligence, over 4500+ km.},

abstract = {Sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events have received increased attention since their impacts on the troposphere became evident recently. Studies of SSW usually focus on polar stratospheric conditions; however, understanding the global impact of these events requires studying them from a wider perspective. Case studies are used to clarify the characteristics of the stratosphere-troposphere dynamical coupling, and the meridional extent of the phenomena associated with SSW. Results show that differences in the recovery phase can be used to classify SSW events into two types. The first is the absorbing type of SSW, which has a longer timescale as well as a larger meridional extent due to the persistent incoming planetary waves from the troposphere. The absorbing type of SSW is related to the annular mode on the surface through poleward and downward migration of the deceleration region of the polar night jet. The other is the reflecting type. This is characterized by a quick termination of the warming episode due to the reflection of planetary waves in the stratosphere, which leads to an amplification of tropospheric planetary waves inducing strong westerlies over the North Atlantic and blocking over the North Pacific sector. Differences in the tropospheric impact of the absorbing and reflecting SSWs are also confirmed with composite analysis of 22 major SSWs.},

The first NRS was deployed in June 2014, and eleven additional stations were added to the network during the following two years. The twelve stations record data that can be used to quantify baseline levels and multi-year trends in ocean ambient sound across the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and island territories within and near to the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (U.S. EEZ). The network provides multi-year, continuous observations of low-frequency underwater sound between 10 Hz and 2000 Hz to capture anthropogenic, biological, and geophysical contributions to the marine soundscape at each location. Comparisons over time and among recording sites will provide information on the presence of calling animals and the prevalence of abiotic and anthropogenic activities that contribute to each soundscape. Implementation of the NRS Network advances broad-scale passive acoustic sensing capabilities within NOAA and the NPS and is an important tool for monitoring protected areas and marine species and assessing potential environmental impacts of anthropogenic noise sources. This analysis focuses on the first year of recordings and captures the wide variability of low-frequency sound levels among and within individual NRS sites over time. Continued data collection will provide information on long-term, low-frequency sound level trends within or near the U.S. EEZ and will be used to explore the value of using soundscape analysis to inform management and mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {A massive vapour cloud explosion occurred at the Buncefield fuel depot near Hemel Hempstead, UK, in the morning of 2005 December 11. The explosion was the result of an overflow from one of the storage tanks with the release of over 300 tons of petrol and generating a vapour cloud that spread over an area of 80 000 m2, before being ignited. Considerable damage was caused in the vicinity of the explosion and a total of 43 people were injured. The explosion was detected by seismograph stations in the UK and the Netherlands and by infrasound arrays in the Netherlands. We analysed the seismic recordings to determine the origin time of 06:01:31.45 ±0.5 s (UTC) from P-wave arrival times. Uncertainties in determination of origin time from acoustic arrival times alone were less than 10 s. Amplitudes of P-, Lg and primary acoustic waves were measured to derive decay relationships as function of distance. From the seismic amplitudes we estimated a yield of 2201310 tons equivalent to a buried explosion. Most seismic stations recorded primary and secondary acoustic waves. We used atmospheric ray tracing to identify the various travel paths, which depend on temperature and wind speed as function of altitude, leading to directional variation. Refracted waves were observed from the troposphere, stratosphere and thermosphere with a good match between observed and calculated traveltimes. The various wave types were also identified through array processing, which provides backazimuth and slowness, of recordings from an infrasound array in the Netherlands. The amplitude of stratospheric refracted acoustic waves recorded by the array microbarometers was used to estimate a yield of 21.6 (±5) tons TNT equivalent. We have demonstrated through joint seismo-acoustic analysis of the explosion that both the seismic velocity model and the atmospheric model are sufficient to explain the observed traveltimes.},

abstract = {Long-range infrasound propagation strongly depends on the state of the stratosphere. Infrasound can be efficiently ducted between the Earth's surface and the stratopause under a favorable wind and temperature structure between 40 and 50 km altitude. Understanding infrasound propagation under variable stratospheric conditions is of importance for a successful verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty, in which infrasound is used as a verification technique. Inversely, infrasound observations can be used in acoustic remote sensing of the upper atmosphere. In previous studies, attention has been paid to the strength and direction of the circumpolar vortex wind. In this study, an analysis is made of the temperature effect in the stratosphere on infrasound propagation. A case study is presented from an explosion during a sudden stratospheric warming. During such conditions, the size of the classical stratospheric shadow zone ({\$}200 km) appeared to be reduced by a factor of 2. The occurrence of such conditions is quantified by evaluating 10 years of atmospheric specifications. It unexpectedly appeared that the size of the shadow zone can become smaller than 100 km, which is confirmed by evaluating infrasound detections from mining blasts in southwestern Siberia, Russia. These results are valid over a latitudinal range of 20N to 60N, which is determined by the stratospheric surf zone.},

abstract = {The estimation of the Green's function between two points on the Earth's surface by the cross-correlation of seismic noise time-series became a widely used method in seismology. In general, very long time-series (months to years) as well as massive normalization and/or data selection are necessary to obtain useful cross-correlation functions. One task of this study is to evaluate the influence of different established normalization methods on the obtained cross-correlation functions. Furthermore, we evaluate two waveform preserving time domain normalizations as well as a new fully automated data selection approach. The cross-correlation functions analysed in this study are obtained from 12 months of seismic noise recorded in 2004 at five seismic stations in the United States with station distances on a continental scale. For practical reasons, the cross-correlation functions of such long time-series are calculated by stacking the cross-correlation functions obtained from shorter time windows. We use this stacking process for the implementation of the waveform preserving time domain normalizations. The time window length is in general an important parameter of the cross-correlation processing, as it influences the normalization and data selection. Therefore, we evaluate the cross-correlation functions obtained with 47 different time window lengths between one hr and 24 hr. The time domain normalizations intend to suppress the influence of transient signals like earthquake waves as well as long-term (e.g. seasonal) amplitude variations. We compare the proposed waveform preserving time domain normalizations with the established running absolute mean normalization and the one-bit normalization. We demonstrate that a waveform preserving time domain normalization can replace a non-linear time domain normalization, if a time window length similar to the duration of the typically occurring transient signals is used. Next to the time domain normalizations also the spectral whitening in the frequency domain is evaluated. Spectral whitening is a powerful normalization to improve the emergence of broad-band signals in seismic noise cross-correlations. Nevertheless, we observe spectral whitening to depend strongly on the time window length. An unwanted amplification of a persistent microseism signal is observed on the continental scale with time windows shorter than 12 hr. Our approach of automated data selection is based on a statistical time-series classification and reliably excludes time windows with transient signals occurring contemporaneously at both sites (e.g. earthquake waves). This data selection approach is capable to replace a non-linear time domain normalization, but no improvement of the waveform symmetry or the signal-to-noise ratio of the cross-correlation functions is observed in general. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {Advances in weather and climate research have demonstrated the role of the stratosphere in the Earth system across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Stratospheric ozone loss has been identified as a key driver of Southern Hemisphere tropospheric circulation trends, affecting ocean currents and carbon uptake, sea ice, and possibly even the Antarctic ice sheets. Stratospheric variability has also been shown to affect short-term and seasonal forecasts, connecting the tropics and midlatitudes and guiding storm-track dynamics. The two-way interactions between the stratosphere and the Earth system have motivated the World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP) Stratospheric Processes and their Role in Climate's (SPARC) activity on Modelling the Dynamics and Variability of the Stratosphere-Troposphere System (DynVar) to investigate the impact of stratospheric dynamics and variability on climate. This assessment will be made possible by two new multimodel datasets. First, roughly 10 models with a well-resolved stratosphere are participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), providing the first multimodel ensemble of climate simulations coupled from the stratopause to the sea floor. Second, the Stratosphere Resolving Historical Forecast Project (Strat-HFP) of WCRP's Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR) program is forming a multimodel set of seasonal hind-casts with stratosphere-resolving models, revealing the impact of both stratospheric initial conditions and dynamics on intraseasonal prediction. The CMIP5 and Strat-HFP model datasets will offer an unprecedented opportunity to understand the role of the stratosphere in the natural and forced variability of the Earth system and to determine whether incorporating knowledge of the middle atmosphere improves seasonal forecasts and climate projections.},

For disturbances whose frequencies are just a hove the lower characteristic frequency of the atmosphere, w2( = h - 1]112 g/ c), the atmosphere responds very efficiently, especially to vertically oscillating disturbances. Furthermore, the response is sharply restricted to regions above the source, and the velocity field in that region consists mainly of a vertical one.

No other equivalent signals were recorded from summer rocket launchings later in the day, although strong signals are recorded from rockets launched at any time in winter. The strong winter effect is caused by the presence of strong stratospheric westerlies, which provide a good sound channel between the stations. This sound channel disappears in summer, when the stratospheric winds are easterly. The few good summer signals are explained by reflection above 100 km because tidal winds at that level in the early morning cause a favorable sound channel between source and receiver. The lower-frequency content of summer signals, compared with that of winter signals, is shown to result from attenuation of higher frequencies above 50 km.},

First, radio frequency (RF) pulses are connected to reconstruct conductive channels created by leaders. Then, acoustic signals that would be produced by current flow through each channel are forward modeled. The recorded thunder is considered to consist of a weighted superposition of these acoustic signals. We calculate the posterior distribution of acoustic source energy for each channel with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo inversion that fits power envelopes of modeled and recorded thunder; these results show which parts of the flash carry current and produce thunder. We examine the effects of RF pulse location imprecision and atmospheric winds on quality of results and apply this method to several lightning flashes over the Magdalena Mountains in New Mexico, USA. This method will enable more detailed study of lightning phenomena by allowing researchers to map current flow in addition to leader propagation.},

Since the error between computed and observed storm azimuths exceeds the theoretical by a considerable amount, a study of the causes of the errors was undertaken. The difficulties are considered to result from instrumentations and procedure, lack of wave coherence at the three elements of the tripartite net, and refraction or multiple wave paths. A large range in velocities was observed, with indications that the lower values are the more reliable.

To keep a one-way formulation, only forward propagating waves are kept in the angular spectrum part, while a wide-angle parabolic approximation is performed on the correction terms. The numerical process is validated in the case of guided modal propagation with a shear flow. It is then applied to the case of blast wave propagation within a boundary layer flow over a flat and rigid ground.},

abstract = {A 1960 experiment is examined in which sound from three underwater explosions near Perth, Australia, was detected near Bermuda. A recent attempt [Munk et al., J. Phys. Ocean. 18, 1876 (1988)] to calculate propagation paths for this event included rotational flattening of the Earth and horizontal refraction determined from the vertical sound speed minimum. That calculation left Bermuda in a shadow zone. The current work invokes adiabatic mode theory to include refraction due to horizontal variations in the vertical mode structure. These results include separate horizontal rays for each of the first few vertical modes, using an archival data set of 230 ocean sound profiles to generate the modes numerically. Where appropriate, interaction with bathymetry is included. This solution possesses two eigenray groups: Group A passes just south of the Cape of Good Hope, at which point group B is almost 1000 km to the south. Intermediate rays are blocked by islands. Group A proceeds unimpeded to Bermuda for a total t...},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview on the recent progress in studying the ionospheric response to atmospheric tides forced from below. The global spatial structure and temporal variability of the atmospheric temperature tides and their ionospheric responses are considered on the basis of modern satellite-board data (COSMIC and TIMED). The tidal waves from the two data sets have been extracted by one and the same data analysis method. The similarity between the lower thermospheric temperature tides and their ionospheric responses provides evidence for confirming the new paradigm of atmosphere-ionosphere coupling. This paper provides also new experimental results which give an explanation why the WN4 and partly WN3 longitude structures are so prominent pattern in the ionosphere. These results present evidence indicating that the WN4 (WN3) structure is not generated only by the DE3 (DE2) tide as it has been often assumed. The DE3 (DE2) tide remains the leading contributor, but the SPW4 and SE2 (SPW3, DW4 and SE1) waves have their effects as well in a way that the ionospheric response becomes almost double (1.5 time stronger). The paper presents also the global distribution and temporal variability of the sun-synchronous 24-h (DW1), 12-h (SW2) and 8-h (TW3) electron density oscillations. It has been shown that while the latitude and altitude structure of the ionospheric SW2 response is predominantly shaped by the migrating SW2 tide forced from below the DW1 response is mainly due to daily variability of the photo-ionization. The peculiar vertical structure of the ionospheric TW3 response, that shows downward/upward phase progression, calls for further study of the physical processes shaping this ionospheric response.},

abstract = {The wind velocity structure in the upper stratosphere, mesosphere, and lower thermosphere (MLT) is studied with the recently developed method of infrasound probing of the atmosphere. The method is based on the effect of infrasound scattering from highly anisotropic wind velocity and temperature inhomogeneities in the middle and upper atmosphere. The scattered infrasound field propagates in the acoustic shadow zones, where it is detected by microbarometers. The vertical profiles of the wind velocity fluctuations in the upper stratosphere (30–52 km) and MLT (90–140 km) are retrieved from the waveforms and travel times of the infrasound signals generated by explosive sources such as volcanoes and surface explosions. The fine-scale wind-layered structure in these layers was poorly observed until present time by other remote sensing methods, including radars and satellites. It is found that the MLT atmospheric layer (90–102 km) can contain extremely high vertical gradients of the wind velocity, up to 10 m/s per 100 m. The effect of a fine-scale wind velocity structure on the waveforms of infrasound signals is studied. The vertical wave number spectra of the retrieved wind velocity fluctuations are obtained for the upper stratosphere. Despite the difference in the locations of the explosive sources all the obtained spectra show the existence of high vertical wave number spectral tail with a −3 power law decay. The obtained spectral characteristics of the wind fluctuations are necessary for improvement of gravity wave drag parameterizations for numerical weather forecast.},

Although variations in both atmospheric propagation conditions and background noise levels at the sensors generate fluctuations in signal-to-noise ratios and signal detectability, array processing techniques successfully discriminate between volcanic infrasound and ambient coherent and incoherent noise. The current global infrasound network is significantly more dense and sensitive than any previously operated network and signals from large volcanic explosions are routinely recorded. Because volcanic infrasound is generated during the explosive release of fluid into the atmosphere, it is a strong indicator that an eruption has occurred. Therefore, long-range infrasonic monitoring may aid volcanic explosion detection by complementing other monitoring technologies, especially in remote regions with sparse ground-based instrument networks.},

abstract = {Here, the implementation of the generalized F detector (Selby, 2008) as an automatic teleseismic signal detector is described. The method is applied to 10 days of waveform data from 13 small-aperture arrays of the primary seismic network of the International Monitoring System (IMS), which is being set up to monitor compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The results demonstrate that the generalized F method can be used as a signal detector at small-aperture arrays, despite the correlated noise that prevents the original F detector being useful at such arrays. By comparing lists of detections with predicted arrival times of first-arriving P-type phases from earthquakes in the Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB, produced by the International Data Centre, IDC, being set up to monitor the CTBT), it is shown here that the generalized F detector compares favorably with traditional signal detection methods used at the IDC, with more candidate associations being made despite the total number of F detections being about half of those made by the IDC. Increasing the proportion of associated detections should improve the efficiency with which automatic bulletins can be constructed, and reduce analyst workload. Further advantages over traditional methods are that the F detector approach is simple to explain, based on probability theory and physical models of noise and signals, treats each array equally and objectively, and does not require subjective tuning. Analysis of the vector slowness distribution of associated and unassociated detections shows that associated detections have similar distributions for both F and the IDC, whereas the distribution of unassociated detections can be different, with unassociated IDC detections at some arrays apparently being associated with correlated noise sources.},

abstract = {We observed the large tabular iceberg A-38B in the time period from the calving event at the Ronne Ice Shelf in 1998 until its grounding near South Georgia in 2004 by means of various space-borne sensors. The initial ice thickness was determined by radar altimetry, the iceberg shape from radar imaging and optical instruments. The freeboard change at different stages of the drift was derived from ICESat Laser altimeter profiles. The analysis of the satellite data confirms that the decay of A-38B is governed mainly by basal erosion. We then used a numerical model for simulating iceberg melting and fitted the melt rate by varying the turbulent exchange parameters for temperature ($\gamma$T) and salt ($\gamma$S) to match the results obtained by ICESat data. Our results show that the iceberg passed through three melting regimes characterized by iceberg drift velocity: (1) In the Weddell Sea melting conditions are similar to the situation under an ice shelf with strong tidal currents which corresponds to a $\gamma$Tof 1.0*10- 4 m s- 1. (2) In the Scotia Sea, where the iceberg drifts unhindered with the ocean current and is surrounded by its own melt water, $\gamma$T, is 0.4*10- 4 m s- 1. (3) At the grounding position friction velocity is again high due to tidal currents and $\gamma$Tis 1.8*10- 4 m s- 1. $\gamma$Sis set to 0.00505 $\gamma$Tin all cases. The analysis shows that ICESat GLAS data together with satellite imagery can provide better estimates of turbulent exchange parameters, which is a step forward in improving the knowledge of fresh water input from melting icebergs into the Southern Ocean. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

New insight is being gained not only into stratospheric dynamics as such, with its implications for pollutant behaviour and the ozone layer, but also indirectly into the dynamics of the troposphere, with its implications for weather forecasting. Similar dynamical regimes occur in the oceans and in stellar interiors. A key development has been the construction of coarse-grain maps of the large-scale distribution of potential vorticity in the middle stratosphere. Potential vorticity is a conservable quantity which has a central role in the dynamical theory, but is difficult to calculate accurately from observational data. We present the first mid-stratospheric potential vorticity maps which appear good enough to make visible the 'breaking' of planetary or Rossby waves, a phenomenon ubiquitous in nature and arguably one of the most important dynamical processes affecting the stratosphere as a whole.},

We analyze fin whale songs recorded at ocean-bottom seismometers in the northeast Pacific Ocean and show that in addition to the waterborne signal, the song recordings also contain signals reflected and refracted from crustal interfaces beneath the stations. With these data, we constrain the thickness and seismic velocity of the oceanic sediment and basaltic basement and the P-wave velocity of the gabbroic lower crust beneath and around the ocean bottom seismic stations. The abundant and globally available fin whale calls may be used to complement seismic studies in situations where conventional air-gun surveys are not available.},

abstract = {S U M M A R Y For the past 5 years (2010–2015) infrasound arrivals have been included in International Data Centre analyst-reviewed bulletins of events detected across the International Monitoring Sys-tem (IMS). In western Eurasia, there are clusters of up to 268 events that consist of only infrasound arrivals (no associated seismic phases). These clusters are of unknown origin, al-though one in the North Sea region is associated with sonic booms from supersonic aircraft activity. IMS data for 17 North Sea events are analysed and compared with data from the Large Aperture Infrasound Array in the Netherlands to support the existence of these events and to determine common characteristics. Three other large clusters in western Eurasia are also identified and studied and show similar characteristics to the North Sea events, indicative of supersonic aircraft activity. The IMS infrasound network is shown to be particularly sensitive to sonic booms because the elevated source height reduces the anisotropy of infrasonic propa-gation within a stratospheric duct and allows for episodic upwind propagation. This episodic upwind propagation in addition to the prevailing downwind propagation, leads to clusters of Reviewed Event Bulletin events with constrained locations in western Eurasia region during the summer months. In the winter months, the recorded arrivals suggest that episodic upwind propagation is not as prevalent. Propagation modelling indicates that the subsequent unidirec-tional propagation, combined with the sparseness of the IMS network, leads to elongated lines of estimated event locations. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) which opened for signature in 1996 includes, as part of its verification measures, the International Monitoring System (IMS). This system includes four different sensor networks: seismic, infrasound, hy-droacoustic and radionuclide (e.g. Christie {\&} Campus 2010). The planned infrasound network will have 60 stations: 49 are currently installed, with 3 under construction and 8 more planned. Each sta-tion comprises an array of at least four microbarometers with aper-tures between 1 and 4 km, and an average interstation spacing of 2200 km. Studies on the performance of the IMS infrasound net-work (e.g. Le Pichon et al. 2009; Green {\&} Bowers 2010) suggest that it is capable of detecting low altitude atmospheric explosions of a few hundred tons or more across the globe. However, the network is too sparse for careful investigation of many aspects of infrasonic propagation (Walker et al. 2011). Infrasound propagates through one or more waveguides in the atmosphere, which are formed by vertical gradients in tempera-ture and horizontal wind (Drob et al. 2003). There are generally three waveguides referred to in the literature, tropospheric (alti-tude {\textless}∼16 km a.s.l.), stratospheric (ground to 40–55 km a.s.l.) and thermospheric (ground to 110–160 km a.s.l.) (Drob et al. 2003). However, the distinct phases predicted to propagate through these waveguides are not necessarily easy to identify due to their emer-gent and occasionally overlapping nature. Furthermore, the celer-ities (where celerity is defined as the epicentral distance divided by the total traveltime) of these phases have bounds which over-lap, which can further complicate interpretation: tropospheric ar-rivals 0.31–0.33 km s −1 , stratospheric 0.28–0.32 km s −1 and},

@article{Shani-Kadmiel2021,
abstract = {In the days following the January 12, 2010 Mw 7 Haiti earthquake the shaking intensity near the epicenter was overestimated and the spatial extent of the potentially damaging shaking was underestimated. This was due to the lack of seismometers in the near-source region at the time of the earthquake. Besides seismic waves, earthquakes generate infrasound, i.e., inaudible acoustic waves in the atmosphere. Here we show that infrasound signals, detected at distant ground-based stations, can be used to generate a map of the acoustic intensity, which is proportional to the shaking intensity. This is demonstrated with infrasound from the 2010 Haiti earthquake detected in Bermuda, over 1700 km away. Wavefront parameters are retrieved in a beamforming process and are backprojected to map the measured acoustic intensity to the source region. The backprojection process accounts for horizontal advection effects due to winds and inherent uncertainties with regard to the time of detection and the back azimuth resolution. Furthermore, we resolve the ground motion polarity in the epicentral region and use synthetics generated by an extended infrasound source model to support this result. Infrasound measurements are conducted globally for the verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and although the network was designed to provide global coverage for nuclear explosions in the atmosphere, it is shown in this paper that there is also global coverage for the estimation of acoustic shaking intensity. In this study, we lay the groundwork that can potentially make infrasound-based ShakeMaps a useful tool alongside conventional ShakeMaps and a valuable tool for earthquake disaster mitigation in sparsely monitored regions.},

abstract = {The motion of a building depends on the excitation, the coupling of the building to the ground, and the mechanical properties of the building. We separate the building response from the excitation and the ground coupling by deconvolving the motion recorded at different levels in the building and apply this to recordings of the motion in the Robert A. Millikan Library in Pasadena, California. This deconvolution allows for the separation of instrinsic attenuation and radiation damping. The waveforms obtained from deconvolution with the motion in the top floor show a superposition of one upgoing and one downgoing wave. The waveforms obtained by deconvolution with the motion in the basement can be formulated either as a sum of upgoing and downgoing waves, or as a sum over normal modes. Because these deconvolved waves for late time have a monochromatic character, they are most easily analyzed with normal-mode theory. For this building we estimate a shear velocity c = 322 m/sec and a quality factor Q = 20. These values explain both the propagating waves and the normal modes.},

The original coordinates of sensors 2 and 3 were adjusted by 75 and 115 m, respectively, removing approximately 4° of error in estimating the arrival angles of signals.

abstract = {The effects of topography and atmospheric structures on infrasonic wave propagation from a volcanic source were investigated using observations and numerical modeling. This paper presents the first long-term observational data set showing spatiotemporal variations in patterns of infrasound propagation at distances of up to 60 km from a persistently active infrasound source (Sakurajima Volcano, Japan). The data show that the amplitudes of infrasonic waves received at distant stations relative to those received at a reference station close to the source can vary up to an order of magnitude over short time intervals and short distances and that they do not follow the theoretical geometric decay expected for homogeneous media. Moreover, waveforms also change significantly in both time and space. Numerical simulations were performed using a two-dimensional finite difference time domain (2-D FDTD) method. Effects of atmospheric structure and topography are included in a vertical section parallel to the wave propagation direction. The simulation successfully reproduced the variations of amplitudes and waveforms. Results are interpreted in terms of wave refraction due to sound and wind speed gradients and wave diffraction at topographic barriers. Our numerical results indicate that both atmospheric and topographic propagation effects are nonnegligible. To evaluate the propagation effects and determine source processes in spatially and temporally varying infrasound data, atmospheric data with a time resolution higher than is currently available are required. If the data are available, the present results suggest that the propagation effects could be evaluated using 2-D FDTD modeling at realistic calculation times.},

Coda wave interferometry is a technique that exploits this sensitivity to estimate slight changes in the medium from a comparison of the coda waves before and after the perturbation. For spatially localized changes in the velocity, or for changes in the source location, the travel-time perturbation may be different for different scattering paths. The coda waves that arrive within a certain time window are therefore subject to a distribution of travel-time perturbations. Here I present the general theory of coda wave interferometry, and show how the time-shifted correlation coefficient can be used to estimate the mean and variance of the distribution of travel-time perturbations. I show how this general theory can be used to estimate changes in the wave velocity, in the location of scatterer positions, and in the source location.},

abstract = {Summary A high speed algorithm for computation of frequency-wavenumber (f-k) spectra is developed, and two real-time infrasonic data processing techniques that it makes possible, are described: (1) Signal detection by a search of f-k space. This process is compared to the N-4 correlator, a broad-band signal detector. The f-k search with a Fisher detector has a theoretical advantage, which we verify in practice. (2) An f-k filter technique for calculating 'best beam' estimates. This technique traces the beam containing maximum power, from frequency to frequency through f-k space, and thus allows for wandering of signal velocity and arrival azimuth. This maximum power function is taken as the frequency spectrum of the best beam. In our programs the Fisher statistic of the signal estimate, and the velocity and azimuth, are computed and displayed as functions of frequency. Examples from real data for both processing techniques are discussed.},

The problem of reflection of a spherical N-wave from an atmospheric inhomogeneous layer with model vertical wind-velocity and temperature fluctuations having a vertical spectrum that is close to that observed within the middle atmosphere is considered. The relation between the parameters (form, length, frequency spectrum, and intensity) of signals reflected from an atmospheric inhomogeneous layer and the parameters of the atmospheric fine layered structure at reflection heights is analyzed.

@phdthesis{Groos2010,
abstract = {Several efforts are undertaken in seismology to turn ambient seismic noise into signal. A key motivation for this approach is to overcome obstacles hampering established methods of active source and passive earthquake seismology. Techniques based on seismic noise are independent from earthquake activity or active seismic sources. This is a significant advantage in areas where the natural seismicity is low and/or where active seismic sources (explosions, large vibrators) can‟t be used. Passive seismic noise measurements can be conducted also in sensitive areas such as city centres and nature reserves due to their low environmental impact. Seismic noise is a low-cost and easy-to-measure signal which is available everywhere and at every time. At the same time the social and economical importance of seismic hazard assessment and mitigation in (mega)cities is rapidly increasing due to the exploding urbanisation, especially close to major fault systems. Site effect analyses, wave propagation scenarios and early warning concepts are high-priority issues for such urban regions. Therefore, the number of passive seismic measurements in urban environments is permanently increasing to provide the required information about the underground by utilising seismic noise. Urban seismic noise is evolving to one of the most important signals of modern seismology. This thesis aims at a better determination and understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of the amplitudes as well as the statistical properties of the (urban) seismic noise wave field. A good knowledge of these spatial and temporal variations of the seismic noise is crucial to identify noise sources on the one hand and to be able to consider the actual noise conditions by the utilisation of seismic noise on the other hand. A new statistical time series classification is presented which is capable to distinguish between corrupt and non-corrupt time series as well as to classify non-corrupt time series in six meaningful noise classes. The time series classification is used to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the spatial and temporal variations of the seismic noise between 8 mHz and 45 Hz in the metropolitan area of Bucharest, Romania. This analysis improves the understanding of the statistical properties of the urban seismic noise due to temporally and spatially varying noise sources. The combination of the time series classification with an unsupervised neural network technique, the Self-Organizing Map method, is demonstrated to be a promising approach to enhance the analysis of complex urban seismic noise data sets. The time series classification is furthermore used to realise a data selection approach for the estimation of Green‟s functions from seismic noise cross-correlation functions. The implementation of this data selection approach involves a comprehensive evaluation of the common seismic noise cross-correlation processing. Based on this evaluation a more flexible processing scheme is realised and critical parameters of the processing such as the time window length are identified. Furthermore, a wave form preserving time domain normalisation and a second data selection approach are presented and evaluated in this context to improve the calculation of seismic noise cross-correlation functions. Concluding, an effective time series classification for seismic noise time series is proposed in this thesis. It is demonstrated that the time series classification can be used to obtain new insights into the temporal and spatial variations of (urban) seismic noise. The time series classification provides furthermore valuable data selection capabilities for all methods utilising seismic noise.},

abstract = {Continuous recordings of ambient seismic noise across large seismic arrays allows a new type of processing using the cross-correlation technique on broadband data. We propose to apply double beamforming (DBF) to cross correlations to extract a particular wave component of the reconstructed signals. We focus here on the extraction of the surface waves to measure phase velocity variations with great accuracy. DBF acts as a spatial ﬁlter between two distant subarrays after cross correlation of the waveﬁeld between each single receiver pair. During the DBF process, horizontal slowness and azimuth are used to select the wavefront on both subarray sides. DBF increases the signal-to-noise ratio, which improves the extraction of the dispersive wave packets. This combination of cross correlation and DBF is used on the Transportable Array (USArray), for the central U.S. region. A standard model of surface wave propagation is constructed from a combination of the DBF and cross correlations at diﬀerent oﬀsets and for diﬀerent frequency bands. The perturbation (phase shift) between each beam and the standard model is inverted. High-resolution maps of the phase velocity of Rayleigh and Love waves are then constructed. Finally, the addition of azimuthal information provided by DBF is discussed, to construct curved rays that replace the classical great-circle path assumption.},

abstract = {Mid to low southern latitude hydrophone stations within the Indian Ocean have recorded two distinct types of low-frequency ({\textless}100 Hz) tremor that can be correlated with drifting icebergs and glacial features along the Wilkes Land coast of eastern Antarctica. The most common of these signals is a variable harmonic tremor (VHT), with spectral peaks that exhibit frequency fluctuations through time. These signals typically display a 4 to 10 Hz fundamental frequency and may have as many as ten harmonic bands. Individual VHT signal packets have durations of up to ∼30 min and occur throughout the year in clusters that continue for hours to days. A second, less commonly observed signal is characterized by shorter duration (25 to 90 s) pulses with a convex-upward spectrogram appearance. These cusped pulse tremors (CPT) often exhibit a near-uniform pulse spacing, with episodes continuing for minutes to hours. Tremor received levels at hydrophones near 32°S, 114°E and 7°S, 72°E reach as high as 142 and 133 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa (peak to peak), respectively. Propagation likely occurs as a sea surface–reflected phase at high latitudes and a sound channel phase north of the convergence zone, with low-frequency transmission loss estimates suggesting maximum acoustic source levels of ∼245 dB re 1 $\mu$Pa at 1 m. Source locations for a subset of the loudest VHT signals correlate with the satellite-derived locations of a large iceberg (B-15D) that migrated westward along the Wilkes Land shelf region during 2002 and early 2003. Most VHT sources, however, cannot be correlated with known iceberg locations, suggesting that these signals also may be sourced from smaller unnamed icebergs and/or associated with outlet glaciers distributed along the Wilkes Land coast. CPT signals have a more limited spatial distribution, originating from five specific regions where ice streams are observed. The harmonic nature of both signal types is consistent with the resonance of an ice layer or fluid-filled cavity within an ice mass.},

abstract = {Abstract A mechanistic model simulation initialized on 14 September 2002, forced by 100-hPa geopotential heights from Met Office analyses, reproduced the dynamical features of the 2002 Antarctic major warming. The vortex split on ?25 September; recovery after the warming, westward and equatorward tilting vortices, and strong baroclinic zones in temperature associated with a dipole pattern of upward and downward vertical velocities were all captured in the simulation. Model results and analyses show a pattern of strong upward wave propagation throughout the warming, with zonal wind deceleration throughout the stratosphere at high latitudes before the vortex split, continuing in the middle and upper stratosphere and spreading to lower latitudes after the split. Three-dimensional Eliassen?Palm fluxes show the largest upward and poleward wave propagation in the 0°?90°E sector prior to the vortex split (coincident with the location of strongest cyclogenesis at the model?s lower boundary), with an additional region of strong upward propagation developing near 180°?270°E. These characteristics are similar to those of Arctic wave-2 major warmings, except that during this warming, the vortex did not split below ?600 K. The effects of poleward transport and mixing dominate modeled trace gas evolution through most of the mid- to high-latitude stratosphere, with a core region in the lower-stratospheric vortex where enhanced descent dominates and the vortex remains isolated. Strongly tilted vortices led to low-latitude air overlying vortex air, resulting in highly unusual trace gas profiles. Simulations driven with several meteorological datasets reproduced the major warming, but in others, stronger latitudinal gradients at high latitudes at the model boundary resulted in simulations without a complete vortex split in the midstratosphere. Numerous tests indicate very high sensitivity to the boundary fields, especially the wave-2 amplitude. Major warmings occurred for initial fields with stronger winds and larger vortices, but not smaller vortices, consistent with the initiation of wind deceleration by upward-propagating waves near the poleward edge of the region where wave 2 can propagate above the jet core. Thus, given the observed 100-hPa boundary forcing, stratospheric preconditioning is not needed to reproduce a major warming similar to that observed. The anomalously strong forcing in the lower stratosphere can be viewed as the primary direct cause of the major warming.},

abstract = {The study of infrasound is experiencing a renaissance since it was chosen as a verification technique for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Source identification is one of the main topics of research which involves detailed knowledge on the source time function, the atmosphere as medium of propagation, and the measurement system. Applications are also foreseen in using infrasound as passive probe for the upper atmosphere, taking the field beyond its monitoring application. Infrasound can be conveniently measured with differential microbarometers. An accurate description of the instrument response is an essential need to be able to attribute the recorded infrasound to a certain source or atmospheric properties. In this article, a detailed treatment is given of the response of a differential microbarometer to acoustic signals. After an historical introduction, a basic model for the frequency response is derived with its corresponding poles and zeros. The results are explained using electric analogs. In addition, thermal conduction is added to the model in order to capture the transition between adiabatic and isothermal behavior. Also discussed are high-frequency effects and the effect of external temperature variations. Eventually, the design parameters for differential microbarometers are derived.},

The signals present a broad variety of spectral characteristics, most of them featuring prominent eigenfrequencies in the 4-7 Hz range, often complemented by overtones. Most epicenters, obtained by combining observations of distant hydroacoustic and regional seismic records, follow the spatio temporal evolution of the drift of iceberg B-15B. Most of the signals are generated during a 36-day time window when it is speculated that B-15B collided with smaller icebergs or was scraping the ocean floor on the shallow continental shelf. We speculate on the possible physical nature of the resonator generating the signals, which could correspond to an elastic mode of the iceberg, or to the oscillation of fluid-filled cracks in the ice. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The reconstruction method accounts for all-acoustic contributions, divided into evanescent microbaroms (detectable directly above the source) and propagating microbaroms (detectable over long ranges). It is computed by integrating acoustic intensities over the ocean surface, convolved with the transfer function quantifying the propagation losses and propagation time. The reconstructed soundscapes are found within 2.7 dB for (Formula presented.) of the measurements in the microbarom band of 0.1–0.3 Hz.

The wave equations for these problems contain singularities at depths at which the buoyancy frequency equals the forcing frequency. One of the advantages of the parabolic equation solution is that it is easy to avoid numerical problems associated with the singularities. Some problems involve an infinite number of propagating modes. This artifact of neglecting viscosity is handled by including stability constraints in the rational approximations used in the implementation of the parabolic equation. The parabolic equation is tested for idealized problems involving surface, internal, and interface gravity waves. Parabolic equation solutions are also presented for range-dependent problems involving internal waves in the ocean and acousto-gravity waves in the atmosphere.},

@article{Kedar2008,
abstract = {Oceanic microseisms are small oscillations of the ground, in the frequency range of 0.05–0.3 Hz, associated with the occurrence of energetic ocean waves of half the corresponding frequency. In 1950, Longuet-Higgins suggested in a landmark theoretical paper that (i) microseisms originate from surface pressure oscillations caused by the interaction between oppositely travelling components with the same frequency in the ocean wave spectrum, (ii) these pressure oscillations generate seismic Stoneley waves on the ocean bottom, and (iii) when the ocean depth is comparable with the acoustic wavelength in water, compressibility must be considered. The efficiency of microseism generation thus depends on both the wave frequency and the depth of water. While the theory provided an estimate of the magnitude of the corresponding microseisms in a compressible ocean, its predictions of microseism amplitude heretofore have never been tested quantitatively. In this paper, we show a strong agreement between observed microseism and calculated amplitudes obtained by applying Longuet-Higgins' theory to hindcast ocean wave spectra from the North Atlantic Ocean. The calculated vertical displacements are compared with seismic data collected at stations in North America, Greenland, Iceland and Europe. This modelling identifies a particularly energetic source area stretching from the Labrador Sea to south of Iceland, where wind patterns are especially conducive to generating oppositely travelling waves of same period, and the ocean depth is favourable for efficient microseism generation through the 'organ pipe' resonance of the compression waves, as predicted by the theory. This correspondence between observations and the model predictions demonstrates that deep ocean nonlinear wave–wave interactions are sufficiently energetic to account for much of the observed seismic amplitudes in North America, Greenland and Iceland.},

abstract = {The first in situ sounding of a post-seismic infrasound wavefront is presented, using data from the GOCE mission. The atmospheric infrasounds following the great Tohoku earthquake (on 11 March 2011) induce variations of air density and vertical acceleration of the GOCE platform. These signals are detected at two positions along the GOCE orbit corresponding to a crossing and a doubling of the infrasonic wavefront created by seismic surface waves. Perturbations up to 11{\%} of air density and 1.35 × 10- 7 m/s2 of vertical acceleration are observed and modeled with two different solid-atmosphere coupling codes. These perturbations are a due to acoustic waves creating vertical velocities up to 130 m/s. Amplitudes and arrival times of these perturbations are reproduced respectively within a factor 2, and within a 60 s time window. Waveforms present a good agreement with observed data. The vertical acceleration to air density perturbation ratio is higher for these acoustic waves than for gravity waves. Combining these two pieces of information offers a new way to distinguish between these two wave types. This new type of data is a benchmark for the models of solid-atmosphere coupling. Amplitude and frequency content constrain the infrasound attenuation related to atmosphere viscosity and thermal conductivity. Observed time shifts between data and synthetics are ascribed to lateral variations of the seismic and atmospheric sound velocities and to the influence of atmospheric winds. These effects should be included in future modeling. This validation of our modeling tools allows to specify more precisely future observation projects. {\textcopyright} 2013.

Ambiguities over Rc scaling, particularly at large scaled DoB (SDoB), translate into unacceptably large systematic errors on yield estimates for this test. Hydrodynamic calculations involving realistic material response models offer a viable alternative to characterize Rc scaling for a range of SDoB where limited data from past nuclear tests exist. Results of such calculations are presented for a granite medium with a material response validated by modeling four phenomenological criteria for past nuclear tests in granite (free field velocity, energy partitioning into the seismic wavefield, velocity attenuation, and measured Rc). These results unambiguously favor the Rc scaling model of Denny and Johnson (DJ91) and the TOC based on that model. Lower bounds on yield and DoB of the North Korean test are constrained by predictions of an SDoB threshold for free surface damage from 2-D simulations since no such reported damage was observed for this test. Constrained by the hydrodynamic simulations, the DJ91 model indicates the minimum yield and DoB for the 25 May 2009 North Korean test is 5.7 kilotons and 375 m.},

For this purpose the ” Large Aperture Infrasound Array” (LAIA) was used, which has been installed in the Netherlands. Preprocessing appeared to be an essential step in enhancing the microbarom signals from ambient noise that strongly influences the results of the interferometry. Both the state of the atmosphere and the noise characteristics are taken into account to assess the strength of the cross correlation. The delay time of the microbaroms between two stations is determined through cross correlating the recordings. By calculating the cross correlations between all 55 station pairs of LAIA, we are able to find the delay time of microbaroms up to a interstation distance of 40.6 km. Using the strength of the cross correlations, we are able to show that the coherence of the microbaroms along the direction of arrival is higher than orthogonal to it. A comparison of the atmospheric state, with a cross correlation, over a period of 10 days, reveals that the infrasound propagation over the array is correlated with the tropospheric temperature and wind. Based on the cross correlations between the three closest stations, we are able to passively estimate the effective sound speed and the wind speed as a function of time.},

abstract = {In an azimuthally anisotropic medium, the principal directions of azimuthal anisotropy are the directions along which the quasi-P- and the quasi-S-waves propagate as pure P and S modes. When azimuthal anisotropy is induced by oriented vertical fractures imposed on an azimuthally isotropic background, two of these principal directions correspond to the directions parallel and perpendicular to the fractures. S-waves propagating through an azimuthally anisotropic medium are sensitive to the direction of their propagation with respect to the principal directions. As a result, primary or mode‐converted multicomponent S-wave data are used to obtain the principal directions. Apart from high acquisition cost, processing and interpretation of multicomponent data require a technology that the seismic industry has not fully developed. Anisotropy detection from conventional P-wave data, on the other hand, has been limited to a few qualitative studies of the amplitude variation with offset (AVO) for different azimutha...},

abstract = {Several recent studies have suggested that the stratosphere can be a source of subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability of Southern Hemisphere circulation during the austral spring and early summer seasons, through its influence on the zonal-mean eddy-driven jet. We exploit the large sample size afforded by the hindcasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecast System to address a number of unanswered questions. It is shown that the picture of coherent seasonal variability of the coupled stratosphere-troposphere system apparent from the reanalysis record during the spring/early summer period is robust to sampling uncertainty and that there is evidence of nonlinearity in the case of the most extreme variations. The effect of El Ni{\~{n}}o–Southern Oscillation on the eddy-driven jet during this time of year is found to occur via the stratosphere, with no evidence of a direct tropospheric pathway. A simple two-state statistical model of the stratospheric vortex is introduced to estimate the subseasonal-to-seasonal predictability associated with shifts of the seasonal cycle in the Southern Hemisphere extratropical atmosphere. This simple model, along with a more general model, is subsequently used to interpret skill scores associated with hindcasts made using the full seasonal forecast system. Together, the results provide evidence of tropospheric predictability on subseasonal-to-seasonal timescales during this time of year from at least as early as 1 August and show no evidence of a “signal-to-noise paradox” between the hindcasts and the reanalysis.},

abstract = {Abstract The method of frequency-wavenumber ?beamsteering? is a familiar tool in seismic applications and radar work where it is commonly used to detect coherent, propagating disturbances in ?noisy? data. However, its use in meteorological situations is not well documented. In this paper the beamsteering method is summarized and its application in a meteorological context is discussed. Three different algorithms are used to detect single waves in artificial data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. Two of these are different beamsteering algorithms:one is a low-resolution scheme where the frequency-wavenumber spectrum is estimated using a fixed wavenumber window and the other a high-resolution method where the wavenumber window is effectively optimized for each wavenumber. These are compared with a method based on the cross-correlation function, which is more routinely used in meteorological studies. The results from this analysis provide a quantifiable measure of the performance and reliability of the three methods when detecting single waves at a given frequency. The performance of the high-resolution beamsteering algorithm is then tested in a similar manner with two waves at the same frequency.},

Observations show GW momentum flux divergence 6 days prior to the SSW onset, producing an eastward forcing with peak values of ∼+145 ± 60ms−1d−1. As the SSW evolves, GW forcing turns westward, reaching a minimum of ∼−240 ± 70ms−1d−1∼+18 days after the SSW onset.

abstract = {Infrasound has a long history of monitoring sudden stratospheric warmings. Several pioneering studies have focused on the various effects of a major warming on the propagation of infrasound. A clear transition has been made from observing anomalous signatures towards the use of these signals to study anomalies in upper atmospheric conditions. Typically, the infrasonic signature of a major warming corresponds to summer-like infrasound characteristics observed in midwinter. More subtile changes occur during a minor warming, recognisable by the presence of a bidirectional stratospheric duct or propagation through a warm stratosphere leading to small shadow zones. A combined analysis of all signal characteristics unravels the general stratospheric structure throughout the life cycle of the warming. A new methodology to evaluate the state of the atmosphere as represented by various weather and climate models is demonstrated. A case study comparing regional volcano infrasound with simulations using various forecast steps indicates significant differences in stratospheric forecast skill, associated with a data assimilation issue during the warming.},

abstract = {Case studies are used to elucidate the relationship between stratospheric planetary wave reflection and blocking formation in the troposphere. The enhanced upward propagation of a planetary-scale wave packet from the Eurasian sector, involving a Euro-Atlantic blocking, leads to a stratospheric sudden warming (SSW). Following the weakening of the stratospheric westerly jet due to polar warming, the stratospheric planetary wave packet then propagates downward over the American sector, inducing a ridge over the North Pacific as well as a trough over eastern Canada in the upper troposphere. The ridge promotes the formation of a Pacific blocking. This result explains why Pacific blockings tends to form after SSW, and why they are associated with suppressed upward propagation of planetary waves.},

The discrepancies between observations and predictions are probably due to the lack of precision in available upper wind models. Here we propose a continuous infrasound monitoring of active volcanoes as a remote sensing method of the upper atmosphere. A refined inversion procedure has been developed for adjusting the vertical structure of the wind in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. The results of the inversion show that the speed of the mesospheric wind jet in the original wind model is significantly underestimated and the strong wind region in the stratosphere should be extended to the lower thermosphere. In this regard, it is expected that a global infrasound tomography would greatly enhance our understanding of the dynamics of the upper atmosphere in a region where routine measurements still remain illusive.},

abstract = {This paper reviews recent progress toward understanding the dynamics of the middle atmosphere in the framework of the Atmospheric Dynamics Research InfraStructure in Europe (ARISE) initiative. The middle atmosphere, integrating the stratosphere and mesosphere, is a crucial region which influences tropospheric weather and climate. Enhancing the understanding of middle atmosphere dynamics requires improved measurement of the propagation and breaking of planetary and gravity waves originating in the lowest levels of the atmosphere. Inter-comparison studies have shown large discrepancies between observations and models, especially during unresolved disturbances such as sudden stratospheric warmings for which model accuracy is poorer due to a lack of observational constraints. Correctly predicting the variability of the middle atmosphere can lead to improvements in tropospheric weather forecasts on timescales of weeks to season. The ARISE project integrates different station networks providing observations from ground to the lower thermosphere, including the infrasound system developed for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty verification, the Lidar Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change, complementary meteor radars, wind radiometers, ionospheric sounders and satellites. This paper presents several examples which show how multi-instrument observations can provide a better description of the vertical dynamics structure of the middle atmosphere, especially during large disturbances such as gravity waves activity and stratospheric warming events. The paper then demonstrates the interest of ARISE data in data assimilation for weather forecasting and re-analyzes the determination of dynamics evolution with climate change and the monitoring of atmospheric extreme events which have an atmospheric signature, such as thunderstorms or volcanic eruptions.},

Gradient winds from CIRA-86 plus rocket soundings, incoherent scatter radar, MF radar, and meteor radar provide the data base and are supplemented by previous data driven model summaries. Low-order spherical harmonics and Fourier series are used to describe the major variations throughout the atmosphere including latitude, annual, semiannual, local time (tides), and longitude (stationary wave 1), with a cubic spline interpolation in altitude. The model represents a smoothed compromise between the original data sources. Although agreement between various data sources is generally good, some systematic differences are noted, particularly near the mesopause. Overall root mean square differences between data and model values arc on the order of 10 m/s in the mesosphere and 10 m/s in the stratosphere for zonal winds, and 10 m/s and 5 m/s respectively for meridional winds.

It is demonstrated that the cross-correlation of thermal noise contains as much information about the environment as can be obtained in active reciprocal transmission experiments with transceivers placed at the two points.

abstract = {A gridding method commonly called minimum cur- vature is widely used in the earth sciences. The method interpolates the data to be gridded with a surface having continuous second derivatives and min- imal total squared curvature. The minimum-curvature surface has an analogy in elastic plate flexure and approximates the shape adopted by a thin plate flexed to pass through the data points. Minimum-curvature surfaces may have large oscillations and extraneous inflection points which make them unsuitable for grid- ding in many of the applications where they are commonly used. These extraneous inflection points can be eliminated by adding tension to the elastic-plate flexure equation. It is straightforward to generalize minimum-curvature gridding algorithms to include a tension parameter; the same system of equations must be solved in either case and only the relative weights of the coefficients change. Therefore, solutions under tension require no more computational effort than minimum-curvature solutions, and any algorithm which can solve the minimum-curvature equations can solve the more general system. We give common geologic examples where minimum-curvature gridding produces erroneous results but gridding with tension yields a good solution. We also outline how to improve the convergence of an iterative method of solution for the gridding equations},

For sufficiently high frequencies which are pertinent to ocean waves and seismic waves, a boundary layer of Stokes' type is shown to exist near the free surface of the solid. Outside the boundary layer, fluid and the solid skeleton move together according to the laws of classical elasticity for a single phase. This division simplifies the analysis of the equations governing the two phases; and several examples of potential interest to geophysics and foundation mechanics are treated analytically.},

The principles of estimation theory are applied to a linear version of the problem, and it is shown that many of the apparently different methods to be found in the literature are particular cases of the same general method. As an aid to understanding, the optimum linear solution is described in terms of the geometry of n dimensions, with n = 3 for .illustration. In generalizing the approach to the nonlinear problem there are two stages: (1) finding any member of the infinite family of possible solutions, which may be done by any convenient iterative method, and (2) finding the optimum solution by satisfying appropriate constraints},

We show that because of the phase speed mismatch between surface gravity waves and acoustic waves, a single surface wave radiates only evanescent acoustic waves. However, owing to nonlinear terms in the acoustic source, pairs of ocean surface waves can radiate propagating acoustic waves if the two surface waves propagate in almost equal and opposite directions. We derive an analytic expression for the acoustic radiation by a pair of ocean surface waves, and then extend the result to the case of an arbitrary spectrum of ocean surface waves. We present some examples for both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional regimes. Of particular note are the findings that the efficiency of acoustic radiation increases at higher wavenumbers, and the fact that the directionality of the acoustic radiation is often independent of the shape of the spectrum.},

abstract = {Snow avalanches produce sub-audible acoustic pressure fluctuations in the low frequency infrasound spectrum that can be detected at significant distances. Although such signals have been previously observed and described, information detailing the characteristics of avalanche generated infrasound signals is scanty. During the winters of 2000/2001, 2001/2002, and 2002/2003 infrasonic monitoring systems operated at several locations in the Rocky Mountain West and collected data aimed at characterizing infrasonic signals produced by avalanche activity. Remote DC powered measurement systems providing a 1 - 10 HZ band limited infrasound signal were deployed within 2 kilometers of controlled and observed avalanche slide paths. Infrasonic microphones coupled to porous hose noise reducing filters were placed on the ground and subsequently covered by snowfall. Results obtained from these efforts have shown avalanche-generated infrasound signal amplitude levels approaching a 20 {\ae}bar dynamic range while occupying a 1 - 8 Hz frequency band. Additional infrasound insights on various avalanche control mechanism signatures, potential interfering event signatures, and ambient noise levels were also obtained. The catalog of data has been utilized to develop avalanche identification signal processing algorithms. Knowledge gained from research results will be applied during the 2003/2004 winter through the operation of a prototype near real-time avalanche alarming system on Teton Pass, Wyoming. Research efforts related to this study will were funded via a Small Business Innovative Research award obtained through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration within the U. S.

@article{Meriwether2004,
abstract = {It has been known for at least 30 years that vertically narrow thermal layers form within the middle atmosphere. Two types of temperature enhancements, the low-latitude to midlatitude mesosphere inversion layer (MIL) and the high- latitude winter stratosphere temperature enhancement (STE), have both received much attention within the atmospheric science community because of their unexplained formation mechanisms and potential impacts on the middle-atmosphere global circulation. Numerous experimental, numerical, and theoretical studies have attempted to explain certain aspects of these respective thermal layers, but no one theory consistently and satisfactorily describes all the features observed. We present a review of the literature and explicitly propose a classification scheme based on the different formation mechanisms suspected to cause these events. For the MIL we demonstrate that there are two subtypes. The first one is tidally driven and tends to occur above {\^{o}}°85 km. This MIL originates from large-amplitude tidal waves propagating into the mesosphere and their subsequent nonlinear interactions with gravity waves, which can often create the appearance of a ''double MIL'' separated by approximately one vertical tidal wavelength ({\^{o}}°25 km). The other subtype of MIL is formed by a climatological planetary wave dissipation mechanism that occurs at a zero- wind line. The dissipation of the planetary wave tends to generate a mesoscale ({\^{o}}°1000 km) inversion layer in the range of 65 – 80 km. These two formation mechanisms explain a host of observed characteristics, including the reason behind the downward progression of some MILs and not others, the different climatological nature of the two forms of MIL events, and the relative scarcity of MIL observations at high latitudes. The STE is believed to be generated by an altogether different process, namely, the nonlinear interaction between the polar vortex and planetary waves/Aleutian High. The induced temperatures typically peak around 40 km and often exceed 300 K, generating what appears to be a ''low, hot stratopause.'' When vertical temperature profiles are combined with synoptic analyses, one observes that the STE is the consequence of high-latitude vortex interactions creating a baroclinic atmosphere, i.e., a downward adiabatic compression induced by an ageostropic flow. We summarize the details of the relationship between this feature and sudden stratospheric warmings, as well as the potential for in situ gravity wave generation. We close with a review of currently unexplained MIL/STE features and offer new directions for future middle-atmosphere thermal layer research.},

abstract = {Observations of the poleward heat transport of the earth (H) suggest that the atmosphere is the primary transporting agent poleward of 30 degrees, that oceanic (Ho) and atmospheric (HA) contributions are comparable in the tropical belt, and that ocean transport dominates in the deep Tropics. To study the partition we express the ratio H-A/H-O as [GRAPHICS] where T (with subscripts A and 0 denoting atmosphere and ocean, respectively) is the meridional mass transport within 0 layers (moist potential temperature for the atmosphere, potential temperature for the ocean), and C Delta theta (C being the specific heat) is the change in energy across the circulation defined by Psi. It is argued here that the observed partitioning of heat transport between the atmosphere and ocean is a robust feature of the earth's climate and reflects two limits: (i) dominance of atmospheric mass transport in mid-to-high latitudes (psi(A) {\textgreater}{\textgreater} psi(O) with C-A Delta theta(A) similar to C-O Delta theta(O) and hence H-A/H-O {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1) and (ii) dominance of oceanic energy contrast in the Tropics (CO Delta theta(O) {\textgreater} C-A Delta theta(O) {\textgreater}{\textgreater} with psi A similar to psi(O) and hence H-A/H-O {\textless}{\textless} 1). Motivated by simple dynamical arguments, these ideas are illustrated through diagnosis of atmospheric reanalyses, long simulations of an ocean model, and a coupled atmosphere-ocean model of intermediate complexity.},

abstract = {Abstract Microbaroms are regular pressure variations of a few microbars (dyn cm?2) produced by the passage of infrasound (?5 see period) radiated from ocean waves. Their amplitudes show prominent diurnal, semidiurnal and seasonal variations that are shown to depend on the presence or absence of one or two atmospheric sound ducts between the surface and an elevation of ?120 km. These ducts depend on the vertical temperature and wind structure of the atmosphere. For our station (Palisades, N.Y.), ducting of sound from the most common source of microbaroms (Atlantic Ocean storms) requires the presence of strong easterly winds at some upper reflection level. Variations (such as tidal) in these winds, as derived from available reports, are shown to account for the observed patterns of microbaroms. In particular, these patterns are shown to be controlled by effects of tidal and seasonal wind variations and stratospheric warmings. Having established the dependence of microbaroms on upper temperature and winds, we use the relationship to interpret these upper atmospheric conditions. Finally, we suggest that use of an expanded ?synoptic? network of infrasound recorders would provide a simple procedure to monitor conditions in the upper atmosphere.},

This observatory, in conjunction with a similar, permanent installation at Boulder, triangulated on sources of infrasound in Colorado. We found that the lee of a group of mountains that includes Long's Peak is a preferred source region for infrasound. Heretofore, such triangulations used long propagation paths usually of hundreds of kilometers, which resulted both in poorly defined source regions and signal source characteristics. The generation of local infrasound is probable when the 500 mb winds are high. A comparison with Boulder's historical data shows that most signals occur during the winter months with durations longer than 3 h. One case study presented shows that source motion can occur (20 km over an 8 h period). The identification of a local, accessible infrasonic source region offers wide opportunities for further research (e.g., the study of an active source region using time-lapse photography, dual-Doppler radar, lidar and instrumented aircraft). Comparisons of infrasonic data with measurements of turbulence reported by aircraft suggest a temporal and spatial relation between sources of infrasound and aircraft turbulence encounters.},

abstract = {The idea of similarity between acoustic fields in a moving fluid and in a certain ” effective” quiescent medium, first put forward by Lord Rayleigh, proved very helpful in understanding and modeling sound propagation in an atmosphere with winds and in an ocean with currents, as well as in other applications involving flows with small velocity compared to sound speed. Known as effective sound speed approximation, the idea is routinely utilized in the contexts of the ray theory, normal mode representation of the sound field, and the parabolic approximation. Despite the wide use of the concept of effective sound speed in acoustics of moving media, no theoretical justification of Rayleigh's idea was published that would be independent of the chosen representation of the sound field and uniformly apply to distinct propagation regimes. In this paper, we present such a justification by reducing boundary conditions and a wave equation governing sound fields in the inhomogeneous moving fluid with a slow flow to boundary conditions and a wave equation in a quiescent fluid with effective sound speed and density. The derivation provides insight into validity conditions of the concept of effective quiescent fluid. Introduction of effective density in conjunction with effective sound speed is essential to ensure accurate reproduction of acoustic pressure amplitude in the effective medium. Effective parameters depend on sound speed, flow velocity, and density of the moving fluid as well as on sound propagation direction. Conditions are discussed under which the dependence on the propagation direction can be avoided or relaxed.},

abstract = {A Whole atmosphere Data Assimilation System (WDAS) is used to simulate the January 2009 sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). WDAS consists of the Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) and the 3-dimensional variational (3DVar) analysis system GSI (Grid point Statistical Interpolation), modified to be compatible with the WAM model. An incremental analysis update (IAU) scheme was implemented in the data assimilation cycle to overcome the problem of excessive damping by digital filter in WAM of the important tidal waves in the upper atmosphere. IAU updates analysis incrementally into the model, thus avoids the initialization procedure (i.e., digital filter) during the WAM forecast stage. The WDAS simulation of the January 2009 SSW shows a significant increase in TW3 (terdiurnal, westward propagating, zonal wave number 3) and a decrease in SW2 (semidiurnal, westward propagating, zonal wave number 2) wave amplitudes in the E region during the warming, which can be attributed likely to the nonlinear wave-wave interactions between SW2, TW3 and DW1 (diurnal, westward propagating, zonal wave number 1). There is a delayed increase in SW2 in the E region after the warming, indicating a modulation by the changing large-scale planetary waves in the loweratmosphere during the SSW. These tidal wave responses during SSW appeared to be global in scale.

abstract = {Ocean ambient noise results from both anthropogenic and natural sources. Different noise sources are dominant in each of 3 frequency bands: low (10 to 500 Hz), medium (500 Hz to 25 kHz) and high ({\textgreater}25 kHz). The low-frequency band is dominated by anthropogenic sources: primarily, commercial shipping and, secondarily, seismic exploration. Shipping and seismic sources contribute to ambient noise across ocean basins, since low-frequency sound experiences little attenuation, allowing for long-range propagation. Over the past few decades the shipping contribution to ambient noise has increased by as much as 12 dB, coincident with a significant increase in the number and size of vessels comprising the world's commercial shipping fleet. During this time, oil exploration and construction activities along continental margins have moved into deeper water, and the long-range propagation of seismic signals has increased. Medium frequency sound cannot propagate over long ranges, owing to greater attenuation, and only local or regional (10s of km distant) sound sources contribute to the ambient noise field. Ambient noise in the mid-frequency band is primarily due to sea-surface agitation: breaking waves, spray, bubble formation and collapse, and rainfall. Various sonars (e.g. military and mapping), as well as small vessels, contribute anthropogenic noise at mid-frequencies. At high frequencies, acoustic attenuation becomes extreme so that all noise sources are confined to an area close to the receiver. Thermal noise, the result of Brownian motion of water molecules near the hydrophone, is the dominant noise source above about 60 kHz.},

abstract = {We present trace element and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope data on volcanic rocks recovered from the submarine Monowai volcanic center, which marks the midpoint of the ∼2500 km long Tonga-Kermadec arc. The center consists of a large (12 × 9 km) partly hydrothermally active caldera and a 12 km diameter ∼1500 m high volcanically and hydrothermally active stratovolcano. The stratovolcano lavas are tholeiitic basalts, which show variable evidence for plagioclase (±pyroxene) accumulation. The caldera lavas range from basalt to andesite, with the compositional variation being consistent with fractional crystallization as the dominant process. The mafic Monowai magmas were generated by relatively high degrees (12{\%}-20{\%}) of partial melting of a previously depleted MORB-type spinel-peridotitic mantle, metasomatized by slab-derived fluids. Strongly fluid mobile 87Sr/86Sr and 207Pb/204Pb ratios of the Monowai basaltic lavas are similar to those from the Putoto, Raoul, and Macauley volcanic centers 200-400 km to the south, suggesting derivation largely from subducted sediment. In contrast, variably fluid immobile 143Nd/144Nd ratios suggest an isotopically heterogeneous mantle along this segment of the arc. Higher 206Pb/204Pb in Monowai lavas imply some influence from the nearby subducting Louisville seamounts in melt generation. The formation of one of the Earth's largest submarine mafic calderas can best be explained through drainage of a single magma reservoir and subsequent collapse caused by trench-perpendicular extension, probably via southward progressive rifting of the northern Havre Trough.

For these problems, the role that small-scale internal atmospheric gravity wave fluctuations play has recently been realized. This paper provides a methodology for representing small-scale internal gravity wave fluctuations which is suitable for infrasound propagation calculations. Adapted from the numerical weather prediction and climate modeling communities, the resulting stochastic gravity wave noise field model is three-dimensional, time dependent, and self-consistent with the atmospheric background state. To illustrate the methodology the resultant gravity wavefields are applied to ray-trace simulations of observed infrasound travel times for a dense seismic network in the Western United States which recorded infrasound signals from a large surface explosion.},

abstract = {The evolution of the Arctic polar vortex during observed major midwinter stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs) is investigated for the period 1957-2002, using 40-yr European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-40) Ertel's potential vorticity (PV) and temperature fields. Time-lag composites of vertically weighted PV, calculated relative to the SSW onset time, are derived for both vortex-displacement SSWs and vortex-splitting SSWs, by averaging over the 15 recorded displacement and 13 splitting events. The evolving vertical structure of the polar vortex during a typical SSW of each type is clearly illustrated by plotting an isosurface of the composite PV field, and is shown to be very close to that observed during representative individual events. Results are verified by comparison with an elliptical diagnostic vortex moment technique.For both types of SSW, little variation is found between individual events in the orientation of the developing vortex relative to the underlying topography; that is, the location of the vortex during SSWs of each type is largely fixed in relation to the earth's surface. During each type of SSW, the vortex is found to have a distinctive vertical structure. Vortex-splitting events are typically barotropic, with the vortex split occurring near simultaneously over a large altitude range (20-40 km). In the majority of cases, of the two daughter vortices formed, it is the "Siberian" vortex that dominates over its "Canadian" counterpart. In contrast, displacement events are characterized by a very clear baroclinic structure; the vortex tilts significantly westward with height, so that the top and bottom of the vortex are separated by nearly 1808 longitude before the upper vortex is sheared away and destroyed.},

This chapter provides an overview of recently developed infrasonic remote sensing methods. The methods range from linearized inversions to direct search methods as well as interferometric techniques for atmospheric infrasound. The evaluation of numerical weather prediction (NWP) products shows the added value of infrasound, e.g., during sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) and equinox periods. The potential transition toward assimilation of infrasound in numerical weather prediction models is discussed.},

Bounds are placed on the phase speed of neutral waves and necessary conditions for the existence of marginally stable waves are derived for the two-layer system. These conditions show how, for the two-layer model, a classification of flows is possible on the basis of allowable marginally stable waves. The classification distinguishes flows with potential vorticity extrema within a layer from those with no such extrema. The stability of particular flows illustrating the classes of flows is examined in detail. Those unstable waves occurring in a current with no extremum are shown to be potential-energy converting while they increase the kinetic energy of the mean flow. Waves which owe their existence to a potential vorticity extremum appear to be similar to barotropic, kinetic-energy converting waves which reduce the kinetic energy ...},

abstract = {Phase velocities derived from ambient-noise cross-correlation are compared with phase ve-locities calculated from cross-correlations of waveform recordings of teleseismic earthquakes whose epicentres are approximately on the station–station great circle. The comparison is conducted both for Rayleigh and Love waves using over 1000 station pairs in central Europe. We describe in detail our signal-processing method which allows for automated processing of large amounts of data. Ambient-noise data are collected in the 5–80 s period range, whereas teleseismic data are available between about 8 and 250 s, resulting in a broad common period range between 8 and 80 s. At intermediate periods around 30 s and for shorter interstation distances, phase velocities measured from ambient noise are on average between 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent lower than those observed via the earthquake-based method. This discrepancy is small compared to typical phase-velocity heterogeneities (10 per cent peak-to-peak or more) observed in this period range.We nevertheless conduct a suite of synthetic tests to evaluate whether known biases in ambient-noise cross-correlation measurements could account for this discrepancy; we specifically evaluate the effects of heterogeneities in source distribution, of azimuthal anisotropy in surface-wave velocity and of the presence of near-field, rather than far-field only, sources of seismic noise. We find that these effects can be quite impor-tant comparing individual station pairs. The systematic discrepancy is presumably due to a combination of factors, related to differences in sensitivity of earthquake versus noise data to lateral heterogeneity. The data sets from both methods are used to create some preliminary tomographic maps that are characterized by velocity heterogeneities of similar amplitude and pattern, confirming the overall agreement between the two measurement methods.},

Systematic comparisons between observations, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) operational analyses including the recent Integrated Forecast System cycles 38r1 and 38r2, the NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalyses, and the free-running climate Max Planck Institute–Earth System Model–Low Resolution (MPI-ESM-LR) are carried out in both temporal and spectral domains. We find that ECMWF and MERRA are broadly consistent with lidar and wind radiometer measurements up to {\~{}}40 km. For both temperature and horizontal wind components, deviations increase with altitude as the assimilated observations become sparser. Between 40 and 60 km altitude, the standard deviation of the mean difference exceeds 5 K for the temperature and 20 m/s for the zonal wind. The largest deviations are observed in winter when the variability from large-scale planetary waves dominates. Between lidar data and MPI-ESM-LR, there is an overall agreement in spectral amplitude down to 15–20 days. At shorter time scales, the variability is lacking in the model by {\~{}}10 dB. Infrasound observations indicate a general good agreement with ECWMF wind and temperature products. As such, this study demonstrates the potential of the infrastructure of the Atmospheric Dynamics Research Infrastructure in Europe project that integrates various measurements and provides a quantitative understanding of stratosphere-troposphere dynamical coupling for numerical weather prediction applications.},

Two types of signals are often observed for a given source: those refracted at stratospheric heights and at thermospheric heights. In this contribution we compare several characteristics of these two signal types including observed pressure amplitude, average travel velocity, bearing, and signal duration. For this study we use archival data from atmospheric nuclear explosions, high explosive chemical explosions on the surface, earthquakes with previously detected stratospheric signals, and earthquakes for which stratospheric signals were not detected. We show that the combination of stratospheric and thermospheric signals may provide independent estimates of wind propagation conditions and source characteristics.

abstract = {This chapter examines the potential improvements in tropospheric weather forecasts that might arise from an enhanced representation of the upper stratospheric state. First, the chapter reviews current operational practice regarding observation of the atmosphere and the relative paucity of observations in the altitude range 40–70 km. Then, we describe some idealised model calculations to quantify the potential gain in skill available from improved monitoring in this region. The idealised model experiments use a relaxation technique with the Hadley Centre General Environment Model, to assess the potential gain in skill from observations both of the whole stratosphere and the upper stratosphere. At weather forecasting timescales (up to forecast day 30), better knowledge of the stratosphere, close to the onset of a sudden stratospheric warming, improves forecasts of the tropospheric northern annular mode. Whole-stratosphere information significantly improved average surface temperature anomalies over northern North America, whilst upper stratosphere information improved anomalies over Central Siberia. These results suggest any new observational technique which can contribute to monitoring of the 40–70 km region would likely benefit tropospheric forecast skill during wintertime.},

abstract = {The hydroacoustic segment of the International Monitoring System (IMS) currently being installed for use in verifying compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), will consist of six hydrophone stations and five supplemental T-phase stations. The ability to detect acoustic signals at T-phase stations relies on an understand- ing of the acoustic to seismic coupling mechanisms. In this paper, we model upslope propagation of acoustic energy at a sloping wedge using an elastic parabolic equation (PE) modeling method. We synthesize both vertical and horizontal displacement waveforms for broadband sources, and show that the signal amplitudes are strongly dependent on the properties of the offshore slope. For all slope types, the signal amplitudes at onshore seismic stations decrease rapidly with increasing frequency. This decrease with frequency is most pronounced for sources with high mode number con- tent at a shallow sloping wedge. Finally, we show that a significant amount of energy can be lost to surface shear waves at the sloping wedge. We investigate the dependence of surface shear wave excitation on seafloor roughness.},

abstract = {The term seismic interferometry refers to the principle of generating new seismic responses by crosscorrelating seismic observations at different receiver locations. The first version of this principle was derived by Claerbout (1968), who showed that the reflection response of a horizontally layered medium can be synthesized from the autocorrelation of its transmission response. For an arbitrary 3D inhomogeneous lossless medium it follows from Rayleigh's reciprocity theorem and the principle of time-reversal invariance that the acoustic Green's function between any two points in the medium can be represented by an integral of crosscorrelations of wavefield observations at those two points. The integral is along sources on an arbitrarily shaped surface enclosing these points. No assumptions are made with respect to the diffusivity of the wavefield. The Rayleigh-Betti reciprocity theorem leads to a similar representation of the elastodynamic Green's function. When a part of the enclosing surface is the earth's free surface, the integral needs only to be evaluated over the remaining part of the closed surface. In practice, not all sources are equally important: The main contributions to the reconstructed Green's function come from sources at stationary points. When the sources emit transient signals, a shaping filter can be applied to correct for the differences in source wavelets. When the sources are uncorrelated noise sources, the representation simplifies to a direct crosscorrelation of wavefield observations at two points, similar as in methods that retrieve Green's functions from diffuse wavefields in disordered media or in finite media with an irregular bounding surface.},

We have conducted a combined metabolome and transcriptome survey of infected leaves between 1 d post infection (dpi) and 8 dpi, representing infected leaf primordia and fully developed tumors, respectively. At 4 and 8 dpi, we observed a substantial increase in contents of the nitrogen-rich amino acids glutamine and asparagine, while the activities of enzymes involved in primary nitrogen assimilation and the content of ammonia and nitrate were reduced by 50{\%} in tumors compared with mock controls. Employing stable isotope labeling, we could demonstrate that U. maydis-induced tumors show a reduced assimilation of soil-derived (15)NO(3)(-) and represent strong sinks for nitrogen. Specific labeling of the free amino acid pool of systemic source leaves with [(15)N] urea revealed an increased import of organic nitrogen from systemic leaves to tumor tissue, indicating that organic nitrogen provision supports the formation of U. maydis-induced tumors. In turn, amino acid export from systemic source leaves was doubled in infected plants. The analysis of the phloem amino acid pool revealed that glutamine and asparagine are not transported to the tumor tissue, although these two amino acids were found to accumulate within the tumor. Photosynthesis was increased and senescence was delayed in systemic source leaves upon tumor development on infected plants, indicating that the elevated sink demand for nitrogen could determine photosynthetic rates in source leaves.},

abstract = {Abstract A new technique is presented in which half-hourly global precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave satellite scans are propagated by motion vectors derived from geostationary satellite infrared data. The Climate Prediction Center morphing method (CMORPH) uses motion vectors derived from half-hourly interval geostationary satellite IR imagery to propagate the relatively high quality precipitation estimates derived from passive microwave data. In addition, the shape and intensity of the precipitation features are modified (morphed) during the time between microwave sensor scans by performing a time-weighted linear interpolation. This process yields spatially and temporally complete microwave-derived precipitation analyses, independent of the infrared temperature field. CMORPH showed substantial improvements over both simple averaging of the microwave estimates and over techniques that blend microwave and infrared information but that derive estimates of precipitation from infrared data...},

abstract = {The International Monitoring System includes a hydro-acoustic part to verify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Besides explosive signals, monitoring stations also detect acoustic waves from earthquakes that travel through the SOund Fixing And Ranging (SOFAR) channel. The travel times of such detections are listed in the Reviewed Event Bulletin, which is statistically evaluated for the stations located in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. The celerities of ridge earthquakes are calculated to build up a homogeneous data-set, based on similar source mechanisms. The celerity is defined as the epicentral distance divided by the travel time. The global characteristics of these celerities can be well understood in terms of temperature variations in the SOFAR channel. A detailed velocity profile has been retrieved for the Atlantic Ocean where large differences (14 m/s) are found between the southern and northern parts of the basin. Propagation modeling with normal modes supports these findings, which shows that the celerity gives an estimate of the sound speed in the SOFAR channel. These results compare remarkably well with those from active experiments, showing the ability of passively probing the SOFAR channel with hydro-acoustic waves from earthquake sources.},

A three-dimensional (3D) geodesic Cartesian parabolic equation model is utilized to study the propagation of low-frequency underwater sound (5 to 20 Hz), the so-called T-phase wave, triggered by a Southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge earthquake. The sound from the earthquake was recorded at 1050 km from the epicenter by the deep water hydrophones of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization network near Ascension Island. A few hours later and at 8655 km from the epicenter, the hydrophones of the Shallow Water 2006 experiment in the U.S. East coast also registered the sound. Recorded field data showed discrepancies between expected and measured arrival angles indicating the likely occurrence of horizontal sound reflection in the long waveguide journey. Numerical modeling of this T-phase wave propagation across the Atlantic Ocean with realistic physical oceanographic inputs was performed, and the results showed the importance of 3D effects induced by the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Atlantic Islands. Future research directions, including localization of T-phase wave generation/excitation locations, are also discussed.},

abstract = {Stratospheric sudden warmings are the clearest and strongest manifestation of dynamical coupling in the stratosphere–troposphere system. While many sudden warmings have been individually documented in the literature, this study aims at constructing a comprehensive climatology: all major midwinter warming events are identified and classified, in both the NCEP–NCAR and 40-yrECMWFRe-Analysis (ERA-40) datasets. To accomplish this a new, objective identification algorithm is developed. This algorithm identifies sudden warmings based on the zonal mean zonal wind at 60°N and 10 hPa, and classifies them into events that do and do not split the stratospheric polar vortex. Major midwinter stratospheric sudden warmings are found to occur with a frequency of approximately six events per decade, and 46{\%} of warming events lead to a splitting of the stratospheric polar vortex. The dynamics of vortex splitting events is contrasted to that of events where the vortex is merely displaced off the pole. In the stratosphere, the two types of events are found to be dynamically distinct: vortex splitting events occur after a clear preconditioning of the polar vortex, and their influence on middle-stratospheric temperatures lasts for up to 20 days longer than vortex displacement events. In contrast, the influence of sudden warmings on the tropospheric state is found to be largely insensitive to the event type. Finally, a table of dynamical benchmarks for major stratospheric sudden warming events is compiled. These benchmarks are used in a companion study to evaluate current numerical model simulations of the stratosphere.},

Here, a spectral stochastic kinetic energy backscatter scheme is used to simulate upscale-propagating errors caused by unresolved subgrid-scale processes. For this purpose, stochastic streamfunction perturbations are generated by autoregressive processes in spectral space and injected into regions where numerical integration schemes and parameterizations in the model lead to excessive systematic kinetic energy loss. It is demonstrated how output from coarse-grained high-resolution models can be used to inform the parameters of such a scheme. The performance of the spectral backscatter scheme is evaluated in the ensemble prediction system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Its implementation in conjunction with reduced initial perturbations results in a better spread–error relationship, more realistic kinetic-energy spectra, a better representation of forecast-error growth, improved flow-dependent predictability, improved rainfall forecasts, and better probabilistic skill. The improvement is most pronounced in the tropics and for large-anomaly events.},

In this paper, a simple, closed-form solution is obtained for scattering by a sphere with a radius that is small compared to the wavelength. Soft, hard, impedance, and fluid obstacles are considered. The solution is valid for arbitrary positions of the source and receiver relative to the scatterer. Low-frequency scattering is shown to be rather sensitive to boundary conditions on the surface of the obstacle. Low-frequency asymptotics of the scattered acoustic field are extended to transient incident waves. The asymptotic expansions admit an intuitive interpretation in terms of image sources and reduce to classical results in appropriate limiting cases.},

To obtain the distinct patterns for band shifting, overlapping, and broadening, original spectra are subjected to scaling so that the spectra after the scaling do not cross one another. After such pretreatment the band shifting creates the tilting of a correlation plane, the band overlapping yields four flat terraces, and the band broadening generates an asymmetric curved plane with respect to the diagonal line in the global 2D phase map. An example of the application of this method has been investigated using two bands due to the CH2 symmetric stretching and CN stretching vibrations in temperature-dependent infrared (IR) transmission spectra of an eleven-layer Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film of 2-dodecyl-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (dodecyl-TCNQ).

abstract = {The M w 5.9 Ferrara earthquake that struck northern Italy on 20 May 2012 was recorded with an infrasound array at a source-to-receiver distance of 300 km. The infrasound record revealed early and late detections characterized by large backazimuth variations, suggesting the existence of an extended area of infrasound radiation. Unlike most previous studies, the modeled area of maximum infrasound radiation appears to mimic an extended flat area (plain of the Po River) with no significant contributions from nearby mountain ranges. The ShakeMap of the earthquake and the map of the reported acoustic boom are in good agreement with the modeled area of infrasound radiation, suggesting how the transition of seismic waves into acoustic atmospheric waves is efficiently exciting infrasound recorded at far distances from the source. Such a result is in agreement with the significant seismic amplification within the Po plain alluvial sediments.},

abstract = {Both paraxial ray tracing and two‐point ray tracing are powerful tools for solving wave propagation problems. When a slowness model is mildly perturbed from a reference model, one can use perturbation theory for the determination of the ray positions and the traveltimes. An extension of Fermat's theorem is presented, which states that the traveltime is stationary with respect to the perturbations in the ray position provided that the endpoints of the ray are perturbed along the wavefront of the unperturbed ray. It is shown that when the ray perturbation satisfies this condition the second‐order traveltime perturbation can be computed from the first‐order ray perturbation. A perturbation analysis of the equation of kinematic ray tracing leads to a simple second‐order differential equation for the ray deflection expressed in ray coordinates. This constitutes a perturbation method based on a Lagrangian formulation, and leads to a first‐order expression for the ray deflection and a second‐order expression for the traveltime perturbation. This is of relevance to non‐linear traveltime tomography because it leads to an efficient method for evaluating the lowest order ray deflection and the non‐linear effect this has on the traveltimes. The theory is applicable both to two‐point ray tracing and to the determination of paraxial rays. The derivations in this paper are completely self‐contained. All expressions, including the transformation to ray coordinates, are derived from first principles. In this way one obtains insight in the approximations that are actually made. A scale analysis leads to dimensionless numbers that give an indication whether the theory is applicable to a specific problem. For the special case of a layered reference medium the final equations are particularly simple. Plane discontinuities in the reference model and the slowness perturbation are incorporated in the theory. The final expressions for the ray deflection and the traveltime perturbation can be implemented numerically in a simple way. It is indicated how applications to very large‐scale problems can be achieved. Several examples, including the propagation of waves through a quasi‐random model of the earth's mantle illustrate the theory. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

A corresponding semi-implicit time scheme is also defined. These schemes am used to compare the usual sigma coordinate with the hybrid coordinate which reduces to pressure above a fixed level and with a modified hybrid coordinate which tends uniformly to pressure at upper levels. Error in the representation of the stratospheric pressure gradient over steep orography can be significantly reduced by use of the hybrid coordinate but the semi-implicit scheme is less stable.

In the past, activity at the volcano had been intermittently observed in the form of fallout at the sea surface, discolored water, changes in seafloor topography, and T phase seismicity, but there is no continuous record for more recent years. In this study, we investigated 3.5 years of recordings at a hydrophone array of the International Monitoring System, located near Juan Fernández Islands, for long-range underwater sound waves from Monowai. Results from direction-of-arrival calculations and density-based spatial clustering indicate that 82 discrete episodes of activity occurred between July 2003 and March 2004 and from April 2014 to January 2017. Volcanic episodes are typically spaced days to weeks apart, range from hours to days in length, and amount to a cumulative sum of 137 days of arrivals in total, making Monowai one of the most active submarine arc volcanoes on Earth. The resolution of the hydrophone recordings surpasses broadband network data by at least 1 order of magnitude, identifying seismic events as low as 2.2 mb in the Kermadec Arc region. Further observations suggest volcanic activity at a location approximately 400 km north of Monowai in the Tonga Arc and at Healy or Brothers volcano in the southern Kermadec Arc. Our findings are consistent with previous studies and highlight the exceptional capabilities of the International Monitoring System network for the scientific study of active volcanism in the global ocean.},

An alternative approach based on spectral transfer functions and the local energy-balance equation of the seismic field is proposed. The method enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical aspects of the problem, which could be treated only approximately and under restrictive conditions in terms of the far-field representations used previously. Three suggested origins of microseisms are considered: (1) the action of ocean waves on coasts, originally proposed by Wiechert; (2) atmospheric pressure fluctuations, as suggested by Gherzi, Scholte, and others; and (3) nonlinear interactions between ocean waves as proposed by Longuet-Higgins. In all cases appreciable microseisms are generated only by Fourier components of the random exciting fields that have the same phase velocities as free modes of the elastic system. The effect of pressure fluctuations associated with turbulence in the atmosphere is found to be negligible. The theory for Wiechert's and Longuet-Higgins' mechanisms is in good agreement with recent measurements by Haubrich et al.},

abstract = {The energy level and its directional distribution are key observations for understanding the energy balance in the wind-wave spectrum between wind-wave generation, nonlinear interactions, and dissipation. Here, properties of gravity waves are investigated from a fixed platform in the Black Sea, equipped with a stereo video system that resolves waves with frequency f up to 1.4 Hz and wavelengths from 0.6 to 11 m. One representative record is analyzed, corresponding to young wind waves with a peak frequency fp 5 0.33 Hz and a wind speed of 13 m s21. These measurements allow for a separation of the linear waves from the bound second-order harmonics. These harmonics are negligible for frequencies fup to 3 times fp but account for most of the energy at higher frequencies. The full spectrum is well described by a combination of linear components and the second-order spectrum. In the range 2fp to 4fp, the full frequency spectrum decays like f25, which means a steeper decay of the linear spectrum. The directional spectrum exhibits a very pronounced bimodal distribution, with two peaks on either side of the wind direction, separated by 1508 at 4fp. This large separation is associated with a significant amount of energy traveling in opposite directions and thus sources of underwater acoustic and seismic noise. The magnitude of these sources can be quantified by the overlap integral I( f), which is found to increase sharply from less than 0.01 at f5 2fp to 0.11 at f5 4fp and possibly up to 0.2 at f5 5fp, close to the 0.5p value proposed in previous studies.},

abstract = {We show improvements in the precision of the Bayesian infrasound source localization (BISL) method by incorporating semi-empirical model-based prior information. Given a set of backazimuths and delay times at ≥2 arrays, BISL scans a parameter space (that comprises the horizontal coordinates, celerity and origin time) for the most likely solution. A key element of BISL is its flexibility; the method allows the incorporation of prior information to constrain the parameters. Our research focuses on generating model-based propagation catalogues using a comprehensive set of atmospheric scenarios, extracting celerity distributions based on range and azimuth from the catalogues and using these distributions as prior probability density functions to enhance the location solution from BISL. To illustrate the improvements in source location precision, we compare the BISL results computed using uniform celerity distribution priors with those using enhanced priors; as applied to: (1) a set of events recorded across a regional network and (2) a large accidental chemical explosion recorded by six infrasound arrays in Eurasia. Finally, we discuss efforts to improve the numerical implementation of BISL by expanding the parameter space to cover a richer set of parameters that can include station-specific celerity distributions.},

These algorithms use a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) value as a detection criterion. In the case of high background noise or in the presence of multiple coinciding signals, the event's S/N decreases and can be missed by automatic processing. In seismology, detecting low-S/N events with geophone arrays is a well-known problem. Whether it is in global earthquake monitoring or reservoir microseismic activity characterization, detecting low-S/N events is needed to better understand the sources or the medium of propagation. We use an image-processing technique as a postprocessing step in the automatic detection of low S/N events.

abstract = {Sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) are usually considered to be initiated by planetary wave activity. Here it is asked whether small-scale variability (e.g., related to gravity waves) can lead to SSWs given a certain amount of planetary wave activity that is by itself not sufficient to cause a SSW. A highly vertically truncated version of the Holton–Mass model of stratospheric wave–mean flow interaction, recently proposed by Ruzmaikin et al., is extended to include stochastic forcing. In the deterministic setting, this low-order model exhibits multiple stable equilibria corresponding to the undisturbed vortex and SSW state, respectively. Momentum forcing due to quasi-random gravity wave activity is introduced as an additive noise term in the zonal momentum equation. Two distinct approaches are pursued to study the stochastic system. First, the system, initialized at the undisturbed state, is numerically integrated many times to derive statistics of first passage times of the system undergoing a transition to the SSW state. Second, the Fokker–Planck equation corresponding to the stochastic system is solved numerically to derive the stationary probability density function of the system. Both approaches show that even small to moderate strengths of the stochastic gravity wave forcing can be sufficient to cause a SSW for cases for which the deterministic system would not have predicted a SSW.},

The acoustic radiation which results from the motion of the air/water interface is known to be a nonlinear effect. The second-order nonlinear contribution to the acoustic radiation is computed and the statistical properties of the received microbarom signals are related to the statistical properties of the ocean wave system. The physical mechanisms and source strengths for radiation into the atmosphere and ocean are compared. The observed ratio of atmospheric to oceanic microbarom peak pressure levels (approximately 1 to 1000) is explained.},

@article{DenOuden2021,
abstract = {Abstract. Geophysical studies and real-time monitoring of natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions or severe weather events, benefit from the joint analysis of multiple geophysical parameters. However, typical geophysical measurement platforms still provide logging solutions for a single parameter, due to different community standards and the higher cost per added sensor. In this work, the Infrasound and Environmental Atmospheric data Recorder (INFRA-EAR) is presented, which has been designed as a low-cost mobile multidisciplinary measurement platform for geophysical monitoring. In particular, the platform monitors infrasound but concurrently measures barometric pressure, accelerations, and wind flow and uses the Global Positioning System (GPS) to position the platform. Due to its digital design, the sensor platform can be readily integrated with existing geophysical data infrastructures and be embedded in geophysical data analysis. The small dimensions and low cost per unit allow for unconventional, experimental designs, for example, high-density spatial sampling or deployment on moving measurement platforms. Moreover, such deployments can complement existing high-fidelity geophysical sensor networks. The platform is designed using digital micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) sensors embedded on a printed circuit board (PCB). The MEMS sensors on the PCB are a GPS, a three-component accelerometer, a barometric pressure sensor, an anemometer, and a differential pressure sensor. A programmable microcontroller unit controls the sampling frequency of the sensors and data storage. A waterproof casing is used to protect the mobile platform against the weather. The casing is created with a stereolithography (SLA) Formlabs 3D printer using durable resin. Thanks to low power consumption (9 Wh over 25 d), the system can be powered by a battery or solar panel. Besides the description of the platform design, we discuss the calibration and performance of the individual sensors.},

abstract = {Mesoscale wind speed and temperaturefluctuations with periods from 1 min to a few hours significantly affect temporal variability and turbulent regime of the stable atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Their statistical characteristics are still poorly understood, although the knowledge of such statistics is required when modelingsound propagation through the stable ABL. Several field experiments have been conducted to study the influence of mesoscale wind speed fluctuations on acoustic pulse propagation through the stable ABL. Some results of these experiments are described in this paper. A special acoustic source was used to generate acoustic pulses by the detonation of an air–propane mixture with a repetition period 30 s. The mean wind speed and temperature profiles were continuously measured by Doppler sodar and temperature profiler, whereas mesoscale wind fluctuations were measured by anemometers placed on a 56-m mast. From the measurements of the pulse travel time fluctuations at different distances from the source, the statistical characteristics of the mesoscale wind fluctuations, such as frequency spectra, coherences, horizontal phase speeds and scales, have been obtained. Some of the obtained results are interpreted with the use of a recently developed model for the internal wave spectrum in a stably stratified atmosphere.},

abstract = {The use of ray shooting followed by interpolation of traveltimes onto a regular grid is a popular and robust method for computing diffraction curves for Kirchhoff migration. An alternative to this method is to compute the traveltimes by directly solving the eikonal equation on a regular grid, without computing raypaths. Solving the eikonal equation on such a grid simplifies the problem of interpolating times onto the migration grid, but this method is not well defined at points where two different branches of the traveltime field meet. Also, computational and data storage issues that are relatively unimportant for performance in two dimensions limit the applicability of both schemes in three dimensions. A new implementation of a gridded eikonal equation solver has been designed to address these problems. A 2-D version of this algorithm is tested by using it to generate traveltimes to migrate the Marmousi synthetic data set using the exact velocity model. The results are compared with three other images: a...},

abstract = {A method is presented to study the life cycle of a SSW using infrasonic ambient noise observations. The potential of infrasound is shown to provide the missing observations required by numerical weather prediction to better resolve the upper atmosphere. The 2009 major SSW is re-analyzed using the Evers and Siegmund (2009) dataset. Microbarom observations are evaluated to identify detections that cannot be explained by the analysis of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Identified differences can be related to either the altitude limit of the analysis, not resolving thermospheric ducts, or to an actual error in the analysis. Therefore, a first-order model is used to relate observations with the analysis, existing of the Waxler et al. (2007) microbarom source model, including bathymetry to allow column resonances, and an atmospheric propagation model using 3-D ray tracing. Daily normalized spectral powers are proposed to distinguish stratospheric from thermospheric return height, based on the different signature of solar tidal amplitude fluctuations. It is shown, that a SSW is not a smooth event as following from the analysis, but a series of abrupt changes with a period of 10 to 16 days, increasing in intensity and duration. This is in agreement with the wave period of Rossby waves, interacting with the stratospheric circumpolar vortex. The type of vortex disturbance, split or reversal, can be deduced from the combined effect of the change in back-azimuth direction, solar tidal signature type and or phase variation of the amplitude variation of the observed microbaroms.},

We analyze the temporal variability in subshelf melting using an autonomous phase-sensitive radio-echo sounder near the grounding line of the Roi Baudouin Ice Shelf in East Antarctica. When combined with additional oceanographic evidence of seasonal variations in the stratification and the amplification of diurnal tides around the shelf break topography (Gunnerus Bank), the results suggest an intricate mechanism in which topographic waves control the seasonal melt rate variability near the grounding line. This mechanism has not been considered before and has the potential to enhance local melt rates without advecting different water masses. As topographic waves seem to strengthen in a stratified ocean, the freshening of Antarctic surface water, predicted by observations and models, is likely to increase future basal melting in this area.},

However, this method requires the repeated computation of test statistics for each element of a grid of slowness vectors, which imposes a high computational complexity and leads directly to a raised processing time. Since conventional systems often have very stringent speed requirements for real-time surveillance applications, this disadvantage leads a limited application of Fisher detectors (FDs) for several infrasonic sensing purposes. In this paper, we propose a strategy for implementation of FD with reduced time-consumption. This strategy is based on the fact that the detection process for slowness-grid elements can be performed in a parallel manner using powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), in contrast with conventional FDs. The results of simulations show that our strategy promises very significant time-savings compared to conventional FDs, which enables it as a good candidate for real-time applications.},

abstract = {Trends and variations in global stratospheric temperatures are an integral part of the changes occurring in the Earth's climate
system. Data sets for analyzing long-term (a decade and more) changes in the stratospheric temperatures consist of radiosonde,
satellite, lidar, and rocketsonde measurements; meteorological analyses based on radiosonde and/or satellite data; and products
based on assimilating observations using a general circulation model. Each of these contain varying degrees of uncertainties
that influence the interpretation and significance of trends. We review the long-term trends from approximately the mid-1960s
to the mid-1990s period. The stratosphere has, in general, undergone considerable cooling over the past 3 decades. At northern
midlatitudes the lower stratosphere (∼16–21 km) cooling over the 1979–1994 period is strikingly coherent among the various
data sets with regard to magnitude and statistical significance. A substantial cooling occurs in the polar lower stratosphere
during winter-spring; however, there is a large dynamical variability in the northern polar region. The vertical profile of
the annual-mean stratospheric temperature change in the northern midlatitudes over the 1979–1994 period is robust among the
different data sets, with ∼0.75 K/decade cooling in the ∼20- to 35-km region and increasing cooling above (e.g., ∼2.5 K/decade
at 50 km). Model investigations into the cause or causes of the observed temperature trends are also reviewed. Simulations
based on the known changes in species' concentrations indicate that the depletion of lower stratospheric ozone is the major
radiative factor in accounting for the 1979–1990 cooling trend in the global, annual-mean lower stratosphere (∼0.5 to 0.6
K/decade), with a substantially lesser contribution by the well-mixed greenhouse gases. Ozone loss is also an important causal
factor in the latitude-month pattern of the lower stratospheric cooling trend. Uncertainties arise due to incomplete knowledge
of the vertical profile of ozone loss near the tropopause. In the middle and upper stratosphere, both well-mixed greenhouse
gases and ozone changes contribute in an important manner to the cooling, but model simulations underestimate the observed
decadal-scale trend. While there is a lack of reliable information on water vapor changes over the 1980s decade, satellite
measurements in the early to middle 1990s indicate increases in water vapor that could be a significant contributor to the
cooling of the global lower stratosphere.},

abstract = {Ambient noise tomography is a rapidly emerging field of seismological research. This paper presents the current status of ambient noise data processing as it has developed over the past several years and is intended to explain and justify this development through salient examples. The ambient noise data processing procedure divides into four principal phases: (1) single station data preparation, (2) cross-correlation and temporal stacking, (3) measurement of dispersion curves (performed with frequency–time analysis for both group and phase speeds) and (4) quality control, including error analysis and selection of the acceptable measurements. The procedures that are described herein have been designed not only to deliver reliable measurements, but to be flexible, applicable to a wide variety of observational settings, as well as being fully automated. For an automated data processing procedure, data quality control measures are particularly important to identify and reject bad measurements and compute quality assurance statistics for the accepted measurements. The principal metric on which to base a judgment of quality is stability, the robustness of the measurement to perturbations in the conditions under which it is obtained. Temporal repeatability, in particular, is a significant indicator of reliability and is elevated to a high position in our assessment, as we equate seasonal repeatability with measurement uncertainty. Proxy curves relating observed signal-to-noise ratios to average measurement uncertainties show promise to provide useful expected measurement error estimates in the absence of the long time-series needed for temporal subsetting.},

As a cross-platform tool producing high-quality maps and figures, it is used by tens of thousands of scientists around the world. The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s, despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike. Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new “modern mode” to complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls “classic mode.” GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw subplots, place insets, and create animations.},

Apart from the chapter by Thompson et al. (2001), comparatively little has been written about the origins of this unique program. Here I will try to provide an informal, completely personal narrative of how WOCE came to be. I have read enough of the methods and concerns of professional historians to avoid making any claim that what is written here is any more than an anecdotal account, relying mainly upon my very imperfect memory, and incomplete records dating from 1977. I am looking back through the wrong end of the telescope. Others who were involved from the beginning almost surely have a very different point of view. If a serious history of physical oceanography in the last quarter of the twentieth century is ever written, the material here should be regarded as at best a starting point. At the outset, I note that much oceanography was conducted outside theWOCE framework, and it would be an error to claim that all of the advances that took place during the 1990s were attributable to it. ButWOCE was surely the centerpiece, many observational and theoretical programs were put in place to take advantage of its existence, and the overlap of investigators working inside and outside the program was so great that attributing toWOCE much of the progress of that time is not a wild exaggeration. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc., All rights reserved.},

We discuss wave guides formed by regions of weak westerly wind. If the wave guide is formed by trapping of waves between strong westerlies and/or the geometric poles, the ducting occurs as a wave propagation in discrete normal modes of the internal wave guide. On the other hand, for wave guides formed by one or more lines of zero wind, waves are absorbed rather than reflected at the zero wind line so that there are no normal modes of the wave guide. Disturbances excited in the lower stratosphere in the equatorial zero wind wave guide will terminate somewhere in the equatorial stratosphere, but eddy motions may be maintained in the tropics at higher levels by leakage from the Aleutian high planetary wave propagating vertically in a polar wave guide. The Aleutian high should he significantly attenuated by such leakage. The theory of zero wind line absorption sugg...},

abstract = {Between 0.1 and 0.5 Hz, infrasound signals recorded in the atmosphere are dominated by ocean-generated noise called microbaroms. Microbaroms propagate through the atmosphere over thousands of kilometers due to low absorption and efficient ducting between the ground and the stratopause. Different theoretical models have been developed to characterize the source of microbaroms, all based on the second-order non-linear interaction of ocean waves. While early theories considered an infinite ocean depth and a source radiation depending on the acoustic wave elevation angle, other works have approximated the radiation pattern as a monopole, and found a considerable effect of the water depth. This paper reviews these models and extends the previous theories to the combined effects of both finite depth ocean and source directivity in both elevation and azimuth angles. It is found that the water depth has a negligible effect for the near-horizontally propagating acoustic waves that should dominate the measured microbarom records. Another important result is that the microbarom azimuthal variation can be highly directive locally, but it generally becomes isotropic when integrated over a realistic source region.},

Thunder exhibits a low Q(0.5 to 2) spectrum with peak power observed at frequencies from {\textless}4 to 125 Hz. Significant differences are noted between thunder from intracloud and cloud-to-ground lightning. Intracloud thunder spectrums show a mean peak value of power at 28 Hz with a mean total acoustic energy of 1.9×1013 ergs. Cloud-to-ground spectrums show a mean peak value at 50 Hz with a mean total acoustic energy of 6.3×1013 ergs. The mean total acoustic efficiency for discharges to ground is calculated to be 0.18{\%}. The thunder power spectrum is time varying. The mechanism of thunder production by a thermally driven expanding channel as described by A. A. Few appears to account for the dominant frequencies observed from many cloud-to-ground flashes, but cannot explain the high-energy low-frequency peaks of some cloud-to-ground and most intracloud discharges.

Rossby's original solution of the barotropic vorticity equation is tested for stability, using beta-plane geometry. When the waves are sufficiently strong or the wavenumber is sufficiently high, the flow is found to be unstable, but if the flow is weak or the wavenumber is low, the beta effect may render the flow stable. The amplification rate of growing perturbations is comparable to the growth rate of errors deduced from large numerical models of the atmosphere. The Rossby wave motion together with amplifying perturbations possesses jet-like features not found in Rossby wave motion alone. It is suggested that barotropic instability is largely responsible for the unpredictability of the real atmosphere.},

The barometer shows that these are accompanied by daily changes of mass distribution of the atmosphere, and consequently with daily motions of the air. In the tropics the daily pressure change is evident on the barographs; in temperate and higher latitudes it is not noticeable, being overwhelmed by cyclonic and anticyclonic pressure variations. There too, however, the daily change can be found by averaging the variations over many days; and the same process suffices to show that there is a still smaller lunar tide in the atmosphere, first sought by Laplace. Throughout nearly two centuries these 'tides', thermal and gravitational, have been extensively discussed in the periodical literature of science, although they are very minor phenomena at ground level. This monograph summarizes our present knowledge and theoretical under standing of them. It is more than twenty years since the appearance of the one previous monograph on them - by Wilkes - and nearly a decade since they were last comprehensively reviewed, by Siebert. The intervening years have seen many additions to our know ledge of the state of the upper atmosphere, and of the tides there, on the basis of measurements by radio, rockets and satellites.},

A transformation of horizontal coordinates products the “semi-geostrophic” system in which conservation of potential vorticity and potential temperature suffice to determine the motion.

abstract = {We analyze global microseism excitation patterns between July 2000 and June 2001. Seismological observations are compared with modeling results to isolate robust activity features of relevant source processes. First, we use observations of microseism source locations estimated by Land{\`{e}}s et al. (2010) based on array processing of ambient noise correlations. Second, we construct synthetic activity patterns by coupling sea state estimates derived from wave action models to the excitation theory for microseisms. The overall spatiotemporal evolution of both estimates is characterized by a seasonal character that is associated with strong activity during winter months. The distribution of landmass causes seasonal changes on the Northern Hemisphere (NH) to exceed the variability on the Southern Hemisphere (SH). Our systematic comparison of the two estimates reveals significant microseism excitation along coastlines and in the open ocean. Since coastal reflections are not accounted for in the modeling approach, the consistent mismatch between near-coastal observations and predictions suggests that relevant microseism energy arriving at the networks is generated in these areas. Simultaneously, systematic coincidence away from coastlines verifies the open ocean generation hypothesis. These conclusions are universal and robust with respect to the seismic network locations on the NH. The spatially homogeneous resolution of our synthetics provides a valuable resource for the assessment of the global microseism weather. Similar to previously identified hot spot areas in the North Atlantic, the modeled distributions hypothesize regions of strong localized activity on the SH, which are only partially confirmed by the analyzed data sets.},

abstract = {Atmospheric sound waves in the 0.02–10 Hz region, also known as infrasound, exhibit long-range global propagation characteristics. Measurable infrasound is produced around the globe on a daily basis by a variety of natural and man-made sources. As a result of weak classical attenuation (∼0.01 dB km−1 at 0.1 hz), these acoustic signals can propagate thousands of kilometers in tropospheric, stratospheric, and lower thermospheric ducts. To model this propagation accurately, detailed knowledge of the background atmospheric state variables, the global winds and temperature fields from the ground to ∼170 km, is required. For infrasound propagation calculations, we have developed a unique atmospheric specification system (G2S) that is capable of providing this information. Using acoustic ray tracing methods and detailed G2S atmospheric specifications, we investigate the major aspects of the spatiotemporal variability of infrasound propagation characteristics.},

abstract = {S U M M A R Y A variety of Earth surface and atmospheric sources generate low-frequency sound waves that can travel great distances. Despite a rich history of ground-based sensor studies, very few experiments have investigated the prospects of free floating microphone arrays at high altitudes. However, recent initiatives have shown that such networks have very low background noise and may sample an acoustic wave field that is fundamentally different than that at Earth's surface. The experiments have been limited to at most two stations at altitude, making acoustic event detection and localization difficult. We describe the deployment of four drifting microphone stations at altitudes between 21 and 24 km above sea level. The stations detected one of two regional ground-based chemical explosions as well as the ocean microbarom while travelling almost 500 km across the American Southwest. The explosion signal consisted of multiple arrivals; signal amplitudes did not correlate with sensor elevation or source range. The waveforms and propagation patterns suggest interactions with gravity waves at 35–45 km altitude. A sparse network method that employed curved wave front corrections was able to determine the backazimuth from the free flying network to the acoustic source. Episodic signals similar to those seen on previous flights in the same region were noted, but their source remains unclear. Background noise levels were commensurate with those on infrasound stations in the International Monitoring System below 2 s.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional radiance maps from Channel 9 (∼60–90hPa) of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-A), acquired over southern Scandinavia on 14 Jan- uary 2003, show plane-wave-like oscillations with a wave- length $\lambda$h of ∼400–500 km and peak brightness temperature amplitudes of up to 0.9 K. The wave-like pattern is observed in AMSU-A radiances from 8 overpasses of this region by 4 different satellites, revealing a growth in the disturbance amplitude from 00:00 UTC to 12:00 UTC and a change in its horizontal structure between 12:00 UTC and 20:00 UTC. Forecast and hindcast runs for 14 January 2003 using high- resolution global and regional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models generate a lower stratospheric mountain wave over southern Scandinavia with peak 90 hPa temperature am- plitudes of ∼5–7K at 12:00UTC and a similar horizontal wavelength, packet width, phase structure and time evolu- tion to the disturbance observed in AMSU-A radiances. The wave's vertical wavelength is ∼12 km. These NWP fields are validated against radiosonde wind and temperature pro- files and airborne lidar profiles of temperature and aerosol backscatter ratios acquired from the NASA DC-8 during the second SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment (SOLVE II). Both the amplitude and phase of the strato- spheric mountain wave in the various NWP fields agree well with localized perturbation features in these suborbital mea- surements. In particular, we show that this wave formed the type II polar stratospheric clouds measured by the DC-8 li- dar. To compare directly with the AMSU-A data, we convert these validated NWP temperature fields into swath-scanned brightness temperatures using three-dimensional Channel 9 weighting functions and the actual AMSU-A scan patterns from each of the 8 overpasses of this region. These NWP-based brightness temperatures contain two-dimensional os- cillations due to this resolved stratospheric mountain wave that have an amplitude, wavelength, horizontal structure and time evolution that closely match those observed in the AMSU-A data. These comparisons not only verify grav- ity wave detection and horizontal imaging capabilities for AMSU-A Channel 9, but provide an absolute validation of the anticipated radiance signals for a given three-dimensional gravity wave, based on the modeling of Eckermann and Wu (2006).},

@article{Trahan2020,
abstract = {The paper presents predictions for the infrasonic attenuation coefficient in the clouds of Venus at altitudes of 50-60 km, where instrumented balloons will likely be deployed. The acoustic wavenumber is obtained by modifying the model of Baudoin, Coulouvrat, and Thomas [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 130(3), 1142-1153 (2011)] to account for typical Venus cloud composition. A two-phase system, consisting of polydisperse aqueous-H(2)SO(4) liquid droplets with a trimodal size distribution and their vapors is considered. Assuming sulfuric acid as the main condensable species, the low-frequency cloud attenuation coefficient is dominated by the evaporation/condensation of H(2)SO(4). It ranges from 2×10(-5) dB/km at 10 mHz to 0.1 dB/km at 10 Hz, exceeding that of the dry atmosphere by up to 2 orders of magnitude. Varying the cloud density by ±50{\%} changes the attenuation by -35{\%}/+100{\%} at 1 mHz and ±50{\%} at 10 Hz. The same variation in the acid vapor diffusion coefficient causes attenuation changes from -20{\%}/+70{\%} at 1 mHz to +25{\%}/-40{\%} at 10 Hz. As the evaporation coefficient of H(2)SO(4) (presently poorly constrained) is varied from 0.01 to 1, the attenuation drops from 10(-4) dB/km to 4×10(-6) dB/km at 10 mHz and increases from 10(-3) dB/km to 2×10(-2) dB/km at 10 Hz.},

@article{Lonzaga2014,
abstract = {Typical infrasound propagation paths extend into the middle and upper
atmosphere before turning back to Earth near the stratopause or lower
thermosphere. The modelling of infrasound propagation is complicated by
several factors. Propagation of sound in the atmosphere becomes
increasingly non-linear as the mean density of the atmosphere decreases.
As a consequence, infrasound propagation, which can follow paths high
into the atmosphere before turning back to earth, is intrinsically
non-linear. Further, attenuation of sound also increases as the mean
density of the atmosphere decreases. Linear propagation modelling
predicts severe attenuation along thermospheric paths, in contradiction
with observation. Finally, the currently available atmospheric
specifications necessarily involve temporal and spatial interpolations
which can lead to the omission of atmospheric fluctuations to which
infrasound propagation is sensitive. In this paper, existing methods for
modelling weakly non-linear propagation are extended to account for the
moving inhomogeneous medium and are then used to study the modelling of
waveforms produced by impulsive events. It is found that there is a
substantial interplay between signal attenuation and non-linear
distortion. Waveform steepening and shocking in the middle and upper
atmosphere associated with higher harmonic generation is moderated by
attenuation while attenuation in the upper atmosphere is moderated by
period lengthening associated with low frequency generation. The
modelling of observed data is then considered. Using traveltime data,
corrections to the atmospheric specifications are obtained. The
predicted waveform evolution, modelled using the developed non-linear
propagation model and the corrected atmospheric specifications, matches
the observations well.},

@article{Meschede2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. We compile and analyze a data set of secondary microseismic P wave spectra that were observed by North American seismic arrays. Two distinct frequency bands, 0.13–0.15 Hz and 0.19–0.21 Hz, with enhanced P wave energy characterize the data set. Cluster analysis allows to classify the spectra and to associate typical spectral shapes with geographical regions: Low-frequency-dominated spectra (0.13–0.15 Hz) are mostly detected in shallower regions of the North Atlantic and the South Pacific, as well as along the Central and South American Pacific coast. High-frequency-dominated spectra (0.19–0.21 Hz) are mostly detected in deeper regions of the northwestern Pacific and the South Pacific. For a selected subset of high-quality sources, we compute synthetic spectra from an ocean wave hindcast. These synthetic spectra are able to reproduce amplitude and shape of the observed spectra, but only if P wave resonance in the water column at the source site is included in the model. Our data sets therefore indicate that the spectral peaks at 0.13–0.15 Hz and 0.19–0.21 Hz correspond to the first and second harmonics of P wave resonance in the water column that occur in shallower ocean depths ( {\textless} 3,000 m) and in the deep ocean (∼5,000 m), respectively. This article demonstrates the important effect of water column resonance on the amplitude and frequency of P waves that are generated by secondary microseisms and that the amplitude of high-quality sources can be predicted from ocean wave hindcasts within a factor of 0.4–6.},

@article{Dowling1992,
abstract = {Perforated plates are used extensively to absorb sound. A screen perforated by a regular array of parallel slits, with a mean bias flow through the slits, is investigated. The interaction between an incident sound wave and this mean flow converts acoustical energy into unsteady vortical motion. This vorticity radiates sound ineffectively, so that a significant proportion of the incident energy may be absorbed. The presence of a mean bias flow therefore leads to a linear mechanism of sound absorption. The maximum absorption coefficient from an isolated screen is found to be 12, but it can be greatly increased by placing a rigid surface behind the screen. It is predicted theoretically that a backed screen with parallel slits can absorb all the sound incident on it, provided the gap between the screen and the rigid surface is approximately one-quarter of a wavelength and the mean flow velocity through the slits is chosen appropriately. Experimental results are presented which show encouraging agreement with the theory.},

The evaluation is carried out on both hemispheres: we make use of stratospheric infrasound arrivals from Mount Etna (37°N) and Mount Yasur (22°S). The near-continuous, high activity of both volcanoes permits the study of stratospheric propagation along well-defined paths with a time resolution ranging from hours to multiple years. Infrasound observables are compared to theoretical estimates obtained from acoustic propagation modeling using the ECMWF analysis. While a first-order agreement is found for both hemispheres, we report on significant discrepancies around some of the equinox periods and other intervals during which the atmosphere is in a state of transition and dynamical oscillations of the atmosphere dominate over the general circulation. We present an inversion study in which we make use of measured trace velocity estimates to estimate first-order effective sound speed model updates in a Bayesian framework. Deviations from the a priori models around the stratopause up to 10{\%} (≈ 30 m s−1) are estimated. Such updates are in line with the results from comparisons between ECMWF analysis and observations from lidar and microwave Doppler spectroradiometer facilities that were colocated during the course of the 2012–2013 Atmospheric dynamics Research and InfraStructure in Europe (ARISE) measurement campaign.},

The discussion of analysis of variance procedures as applied to signals shows that the answers can be interpreted in terms of statistical significance, that measurements of coherent signal power can be made, and that the accuracy of such measurements is greatly improved as the number of input signals is increased. Signal-to-noise ratio is shown to be uniquely related to statistical significance, and signal detectability is plotted as a function of number of inputs and signal duration.

@article{Gardner1995,
abstract = {Shear and convective instabilities, Doppler spreading, and nonlinear wave-wave interactions are mechanisms which have been proposed to explain the form of the gravity wave vertical wave number spectrum of horizontal winds. In this paper we present an alternative explanation by assuming that the damping effects of molecular viscosity, turbulence, and off-resonance wave-wave interactions can all be characterized in terms of a scale-independent diffusivity (D) which increases with altitude. The components of the gravity wave source spectrum are assumed to grow exponentially with increasing altitude in response to decreasing atmospheric density until they are removed by diffusive damping. A wave of intrinsic frequency Cu and vertical wave number m is assumed to be completely damped when the effective vertical velocity of momentum diffusion (mD) exceeds the vertical phase velocity of the wave ($\omega$/m). Only waves satisfying mD {\textless} $\omega$/m, or equivalently m2D {\textless} $\omega$ and m {\textless} ($\omega$/D)½ are permitted to grow in amplitude as they propagate upward in the atmosphere. If the gravity wave temporal spectrum of horizontal winds varies as $\omega$−p, we show that the vertical wave number spectrum must vary as m−2p + 1 and the zonal (or meridional) wave number spectrum must vary as $\omega$−p we show that the vertical wave number spectrum must very as k−(2p + 1)/3. For p = 2, and $\omega$ m and $\omega$ spectra are and where N is the buoyancy frequency, ƒ is the inertial frequency, is a form of the Richardson number, and is the variance of the vertical shear of the horizontal wind. Similar models are developed for scale-dependent diffusion. In this case the spectra are proportional to $\omega$−p, m−3 and k(−p - 1)/(p + 1). Because the joint (m, $\omega$) intrinsic spectra for both scale-independent and scale-dependent diffusive filtering are not separable, the theory predicts that the m spectra of vertical winds are proportional to m5 - 2p for scale-independent diffusion and m(7 - 3p)/(p - 1) for scale-dependent diffusion. The model spectra compare favorably with recent lidar and radar observations of middle atmosphere density, temperature, and wind fluctuations.},

abstract = {14 microbarograph arrays recorded infrasonic signals at distances of between 53 and 930 km from six large chemical explosions detonated at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico, US, over an 18 d period during August 2012: the Humming Roadrunner trials. Atmospheric sound speed profiles derived from state-of-the-art meteorological specifications predicted a weak stratospheric duct to stations due west of the six explosions, with effective sound speed ratios between the stratosphere and ground surface of between 0.99 and 1.04. Only thermospheric ducts were predicted along meridional paths. For all explosions, a wider range of signals than predicted by infrasonic propagation modelling is observed. The geographical extent of zonal path observations is significantly greater than predicted, with the first stratospheric return recorded within the modelled shadow zones and out to distances of 900 km. In addition, extended signal coda lasting up to 300 s was recorded, indicative of acoustic multipathing from fine-scale unmodelled atmospheric structure. Along predominantly meridional path arrivals consistent with acoustic refraction in the stratosphere, mesosphere and thermosphere were recorded with celerities between 235 and 295 m s -1 . 24 U-shaped phases were recorded across the six explosions; those with the slowest celerities (220-240 m s -1 ) exhibited periods of up to 16 s, in comparison to phases with stratospheric celerities ({\textgreater}280 m s -1 ) that had periods {\textless}3 s. This is consistent with nonlinear waveform stretching along thermospheric paths. Within the geometric stratospheric shadow zone, at distances of between 53 and 95 km from the source, several tens of seconds of signal coda were recorded, with increasing apparent velocity with time. Preliminary modelling suggests these returns were partially reflected from lower stratospheric ({\textless}35 km) altitudes. The presence of geographically extensive stratospheric zonal returns, meridional stratospheric returns and extended signal coda adds to a growing body of evidence that operational meteorological specifications do not capture the detail required to synthesize regional infrasonic waveforms.},

abstract = {Active volcanoes in the Vanuatu archipelago permanently generate infrasonic waves. Their monitoring over 1 year exhibits clear seasonal trends in the direction of arrival of the detected signals. From summer to winter the azimuth variation reaches 15°. This deviation is essentially due to the reversibility of the zonal stratospheric wind with season which strongly affects the deflection of the ray direction. A three-dimensional (3-D) ray-tracing modeling roughly explains the observed seasonal trend in the azimuth variation but underestimates its amplitude. The discrepancy between the measurements and the results of simulation is explained by undervalued wind speeds in the upper atmosphere. Infrasonic observations are used as input of an inversion scheme for adjusting the vertical structure of the wind in the upper stratosphere and mesosphere. It is shown that the mesospheric zonal winds are underestimated by at least 20 m/s throughout the year with differences reaching 50 m/s.},

It is shown that correlating infrasound detections with results from a electromagnetic lightning detection network is successful up to distances of 50 km from the infrasound array. Infrasound recordings clearly show blastwave characteristics which can be related to cloud-ground discharges, with a dominant frequency between 1–5 Hz. Amplitude measurements of CG discharges can partly be explained by the beam pattern of a line source with a dominant frequency of 3.9 Hz, up to a distance of 20 km. The ability to measure lightning activity with infrasound arrays has both positive and negative implications for CTBT verification purposes. As a scientific application, lightning studies can benefit from the worldwide infrasound verification system.},

abstract = {A dry general circulation model is used to investigate how coupling between the stratospheric polar vortex and the extratropical tropospheric circulation depends on the latitude of the tropospheric jet. The tropo- spheric response to an identical stratospheric vortex configuration is shown to be strongest for a jet centered near 408 and weaker for jets near either 308 or 508 by more than a factor of 3. Stratosphere-focused mecha- nisms based on stratospheric potential vorticity inversion, eddy phase speed, and planetary wave reflection, as well as arguments based on tropospheric eddy heat flux and zonal length scale, appear to be incapable of explaining the differences in the magnitude of the jet shift. In contrast, arguments based purely on tropo- spheric variability involving the strength of eddy–zonal mean flow feedbacks and jet persistence, and related changes in the synoptic eddy momentum flux, appear to explain this effect. The dependence of coupling between the stratospheric polar vortex and the troposphere on tropospheric jet latitude found here is con- sistent with 1) the observed variability in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific and 2) the trend in the Southern Hemisphere as projected by comprehensive models.},

@article{Sabra2005,
abstract = {Objective: The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of risk factors and their influence on - the distribution and manifestation of - hearing loss in infants. The study was conducted at the Department of Laryngology in the Upper Silesian Center for Child Health in Katowice (Poland), as part of the Polish National Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening, conducted from 2003 to 2009. Materials and methods: The selected population included every newborn that twice tested positive on the transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE) screening test, as well as all neonates with one or more risk factors as defined by the Joint Committee of Infant Hearing in 2000 (JCIH).The following procedures were used with each neonate: otolaryngological examination (with otoscopy), tympanometry, automated otoacoustic emission (AOAE), and auditory brainstem response (ABR).A total of 5282 infants were examined. Subjects were categorized into two groups: the first group consisted of 2986 (56.53{\%}) neonates with risk factors of hearing loss, while the second group included 2296 (43.47{\%}) neonates without any known risk factors, but who twice tested positive on the TEOAE screening. Results: Among all infants examined (5282), sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) was identified in 240 cases (4.54{\%}), and conductive hearing loss (CHL) in 40 cases (0.76{\%}), while normal hearing (NH) appeared in 5002 cases (94.70{\%}).In the first group, SNHL was identified in 128 neonates (4.29{\%}), and CHL in 28 (0.94{\%}), while NH appeared in 2830 (94.78{\%}). The largest percentage of SNHL (15.52{\%}) appeared in children with identified or suspected syndromes associated with hearing loss. The next highest frequency of SNHL was comprised of children subjected to mechanical ventilation for a period in excess of 5 days (11.45{\%}).Only a small percentage (2.86{\%}) of SNHL appeared to be due to the use of ototoxic medications, despite the fact that this factor is the most prevalent (33.13{\%}) of all analyzed risk factors of hearing impairment. After ototoxic medications, the frequencies of risk factors are as follows: premature birth (16.21{\%}); low birth weight (12.04{\%}); intensive care in excess of 7 days (10.64{\%}). Furthermore, as the number of coexisting risk factors increases, the probability of SNHL in infants is seen to also increase. For children with one to four coexisting risk factors, the probability of SNHL ranges from 3.15{\%} to 5.56{\%}; for five or more risk factors the probability nearly doubles. Conclusion: Our results indicate that syndromes associated with hearing loss and mechanical ventilation for more than 5 days were statistically significant risk factors in the occurrence of hearing loss. The most common risk factors are ototoxic medications, premature birth, low birth weight, and intensive care in excess of 7 days. As the number of risk factors an infant is exposed to grows, the probability of hearing impairment increases. The large percentage of children with sensorineural hearing loss in the absence of any known risk factors demonstrates the necessity of hearing examinations in all neonates. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

The monthly median of K shows a local maximum near the tropopause jet stream altitude. It becomes larger in the mesosphere, increasing gradually with height. Maxima of K are observed in winter near the tropopause and in summer in the mesosphere, and the seasonal variability of K reaches approximately an order of magnitude. A semiannual variability is apparent in the mesosphere with minima in the equinoctial seasons.},

abstract = {Waves that propagate between two receivers can be extracted by cross correlating noise recorded at these receivers if the noise is generated by sources on a closed surface surrounding the receivers. This concept is called seismic interferometry. Of all these noise sources, those for whom the travel time difference for propagation to the two receivers is in the stationary phase zone, give the dominant contribution. In this paper we analyze the stationary phase properties when one receiver is at a caustic for waves leaving the other receiver. A simple model for a waveguide and a general treatment of caustics show that, at a caustic, the curvature of the travel time difference at the stationary phase zone vanishes. As a result the stationary phase region is considerably wider at a caustic than at other points, and it is more likely that noise sources are present in the stationary phase region. This explains why it is easier to extract waves from seismic interferometry when the receivers are at caustics such as antipodal receivers on the Earth.},

abstract = {A qualitative analysis of ocean microseism source distribution observed in North America during fall and winter months was carried out. I review the theory of the origin of ocean microseisms and show that it can be used in conjunction with wave-wave interaction maps to quantify the source distribution anisotropy. It is demonstrated that microseisms generation in the North Atlantic and in the North Pacific Oceans are inherently different. North Atlantic microseisms are generated predominantly in the deep ocean, while North Pacific microseisms are dominated by coastal reflections. In spite of these differences both result from repeated ocean wave patterns that give rise to an anisotropic noise pattern, which cannot be randomized by time averaging. Considering time-varying ambient noise imaging, which aims to resolve a fraction of a percent changes in the crust over short distances, the source anisotropy would introduce a relatively significant error that needs to be accounted for. {\textcopyright} 2011 Acad{\'{e}}mie des sciences.},

abstract = {This is an account of a few of the major findings about large-scale ocean circulation of the last few decades and perhaps some evaluations and comments on the past work. We have collected vast amounts of data, from conventional hydrographic measurements with bottles and thermometers, bathythermographs, CTDs, ADCPs, current meters, drogues, drifters, and satellites. And we have computers that let us process, map, and calculate at speeds that we could not have dreamed of in 1950. The data set has revealed many features new to the field, confirmed many others, corrected some serious errors of the past, and allowed many investigations that had not been possible before. Most of our findings about ocean circulation have resulted from measurements of the ocean. The major theoretical results so far-Ekman transport, western intensification, and Sverdrup transport-followed from the results of measurements. We have learned more about the manner of formation of thewaters in the various basins, and their flow from basin to basin, the circulation of the large gyres, the flow along the boundaries, the penetration of the waters from the circumpolar flow into the various oceans, the equatorial circulation, and the transports of the major currents. We have learned much of this from examining the patterns of the various tracers and from the density fields, which reflect the geostrophic flow. We have also found that some of our early views of the circulation were wrong, and it is interesting to ponder why they were wrong and whether the earlier data could have given better answers. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc., All rights reserved.},

Archived acoustic records show that the high-intensity underwater sounds accompanying this breakup increased ocean noise levels at mid-to-equatorial latitudes over a period of 1.5 years. More typically, seasonal variations in ocean noise, which are characterized by austral summer-highs and winter-lows, appear to be modulated by the annual cycle of Antarctic iceberg drift and subsequent disintegration. This seasonal pattern is observed in all three Oceans of the Southern Hemisphere. The life cycle of Antarctic icebergs affects not only marine ecosystem but also the sound environment in far-reaching areas and must be accounted for in any effort to isolate anthropogenic or climateinduced noise contributions to the ocean soundscape.},

abstract = {A variety of methods exist for interpolating Cartesian or spherical surface data onto an equidistant lattice in a procedure known as gridding. Methods based on Green's functions are particularly simple to implement. In such methods, the Green's function for the gridding operator is determined and the resulting gridding solution is composed of the superposition of contributions from each data constraint, weighted by the Green's function evaluated for all output–input point separations. The Green's function method allows for considerable flexibility, such as complete freedom in specifying where the solution will be evaluated (it does not have to be on a lattice) and the ability to include both surface heights and surface gradients as data constraints. Green's function solutions for Cartesian data in 1-, 2- and 3-D spaces are well known, as is the dilogarithm solution for minimum curvature spline on a spherical surface. Here, the spherical surface case is extended to include tension and the new generalized Green's function is derived. It is shown that the new function reduces to the dilogarithm solution in the limit of zero tension. Properties of the new function are examined and the new gridding method is implemented in Matlab{\textregistered} and demonstrated on three geophysical data sets.},

abstract = {Microbaroms are continuous infrasonic signals with a dominant frequency around 0.2 Hz produced by ocean surface waves. Monitoring stations around the globe routinely detect strong microbaroms in the lee of tropical cyclones. We utilize a parametric wind model and a spectral wave model to construct the tropical cyclone wave field and a theoretical acoustic source model to describe the intensity, spatial distribution, and dynamics of microbarom sources. This approach excludes ambient wave conditions and facilitates a parametric analysis to elucidate the source mechanism within the storm. A stationary tropical cyclone produces the strongest microbarom signals at the center, where the waves generated by the cyclonic winds converge. As the tropical cyclone moves forward, the converging wave field becomes less coherent and lags and expands behind the storm center. The models predict a direct relation between the storm forward speed and the location of maximum microbarom source intensity consistent with the infrasonic observations from Hurricane Felicia 2009 in the North Central Pacific.},

abstract = {A large meteor entered the atmosphere above northeastern Oregon on 19 February 2008 at 530 PST. Several hundreds of broadband seismic stations in the U.S. Pacific Northwest recorded acoustic‐to‐seismic coupled signals from this event. The travel times of the first arriving energy are consistent with a terminal explosion source model, suggesting that the large size of the explosion masked any signals associated with a continuous line source along its supersonic trajectory. Several infrasound arrays in North America also recorded this event. Both the seismic and infrasound data have been used to locate the explosion in 3‐D space and time. Climatological atmospheric velocity models predict that infrasound signals from sources that occur at mid‐northern latitudes in winter are usually ducted to the east due to eastward zonal winds. In this paper, we analyze travel time picks and use 3‐D ray tracing to generate synthetic travel times based on various atmospheric models to show that the seismic network data instead reveal a predominant westward propagation direction. A sudden stratospheric warming event that reversed the zonal wind flow explains this westward propagation. The seismic data illuminate in unprecedented spatial detail the range and azimuthal definition of shadow zones out to a range of 500 km, suggesting that dense seismic networks can be used to study infrasound propagation at spatial resolutions that exceed that which can be done with only a handful of globally distributed infrasound arrays.},

abstract = {Noise spectra have been mapped out by the 1/3rd octave band analysis in a Gas-to-Liquid Plant in the swampy area of the Niger Delta using a Pulsar Model 33 Spectrum Analyser. The analyses with a CESVA Capture Studio Software were carried out in seven Zones. Results show that Zones 2 (Trains area), 3 (Process area) and 7 (Deluge equipment and Custody meter area) had peak mean Band Pressure Noise Level between 85.3 dB - 89.9 dB above the DPR limit, a level which is the starting point where damage risk to hearing is thought to be imminent and at the 2 - 4 kHz frequencies range where the normal human ear is more responsive. These Zones also had high levels of annoyance due to the heavy duty machines and plants and rotating parts of machinery in constant daily operation. Zones 5 (Pig launcher/Receiver and slug catcher area) and 6 (LPG storage area having Spherical tanks only) registered peak mean Band Pressure Noise Level of 83.5 dB and 86.6 dB respectively at the 20 Hz frequency band due to their proximity to the nearby Gas flare area. Such low frequency noises can be harmful to body resonance especially the head-neck shoulder system of employees. Zones 1(Office and water utility area) and 4 (Hot oil area) registered noise levels less than 85 dB at low frequencies because of the absence of the machinery that generates high noise and their distances away from the Gas flare area. These suggest that the type of noise dominant within the Plant was discrete noise obscured by broadband noise. Impact noise may not have been experienced since there were no operations generating such type of noise. {\textcopyright} EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2008.},

This enhanced surveillance radar tracks all aircraft in sight every 4 s, generating one million wind and temperature observations per day in a radius of 270 km around the radar. Nowcasting applications will benefit from improved three-dimensional wind fields. When these observations are assimilated into a numerical model with an hourly update cycle, the short-range three-dimensional wind field forecasts match the observations better than those from an operational forecast cycle, which is updated every 3 h. The positive impact on wind in the first hours of the forecast gradually turns into a neutral impact, when compared to other wind and temperature observations. The timeliness of the forecasts combined with the high resolution of the observations are the main reasons for the observed nowcasting benefits. All in all, the assimilation of high-resolution wind (and temperature) observations is found to be beneficial for nowcasting and short-range forecasts up to 2?3 h.},

For the subsequent nuclear test in 2013 corresponding arrivals were again identified at these stations, but could also be detected at the two closest IMS stations in Russia (IS45) and Japan (IS30) and were associated to the event in the Reviewed Event Bulletin of the CTBTO. When the nuclear test in January 2016 occurred and infrasound signals for IS45 were reported, it spurred this investigation of potential observations from such events conducted over the past 10 or more years. By applying F-K analyses interactively on the data of IMS infrasound stations IS45 and IS30 we verified the detections for the 2013 event, but found additional signals related to other tests except for the 2009 and September 2016 events. Additionally, we found a signal in 2009 at IS45 that we interpret as being related to the source for which a precursory signal was identified at the regional infrasound station network in South Korea. We also investigated the potential for infrasound observations for a small seismic event in May 2010 on the test site and obtained some evidence for a very weak signal. By atmospheric propagation modeling using ray tracing and parabolic equation calculations we aim at interpreting the observations and attempt to explain the corresponding arrival times of signals. As most of the signals are hidden in the background noise, we also studied the detection pattern of IS45 and IS30 in order to assess the probability of the identified signals to be random observations coming from preferred arrival directions.},

abstract = {In the Philippine Sea, from April 2010 to March 2011, a 330-km radius pentagonal acoustic transceiver array with a sixth transceiver in the center transmitted broadband signals with center frequencies between 172 and 275 Hz and 100 Hz bandwidth eight times a day every other day. The signals were recorded on a large-aperture vertical-line array located near the center of the pentagon at ranges of 129, 210, 224, 379, 396, and 450 km. The acoustic arrival structures are interpretable in terms of ray paths. Depth and time variability of the acoustic observations are analyzed for six ray paths (one from each transceiver) with similar vertical sampling properties in the main thermocline. Acoustic-field statistics treated include: (1) variances of phase and intensity, (2) vertical coherence and intensity covariance, (3) glinting and fadeout rates, and (4) intensity probability density functions. Several observed statistics are compared to predictions using Feynman path-integral theory assuming the Garrett-Munk internal-wave spectrum. In situ oceanographic observations support this assumption and are used to estimate spectral parameters. Data and theory differ at most by a factor of two and reveal the wave propagation regimes of unsaturated, partially saturated, and fully saturated. Improvements to the evaluation of path-integral quantities are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2019 U.S. Government.},

Shipping, resource exploration, and infrastructure development have increased the anthrophony (sounds generated by human activities), whereas the biophony (sounds of biological origin) has been reduced by hunting, fishing, and habitat degradation. Climate change is affecting geophony (abiotic, natural sounds). Existing evidence shows that anthrophony affects marine animals at multiple levels, including their behavior, physiology, and, in extreme cases, survival. This should prompt management actions to deploy existing solutions to reduce noise levels in the ocean, thereby allowing marine animals to reestablish their use of ocean sound as a central ecological trait in a healthy ocean.},

abstract = {In order to discriminate between man-made explosions and earthquakes, a preliminary seismo-acoustic analysis was performed in the Korean Peninsula from August 1999 to December 2000. During this time, 202 seismo-acoustic events were identified as blasts. These events were concentrated in specific regions: a rock quarry, an open-pit mine and a construction site, which were identified by field survey. All of these events occurred within 200 km of a seismo-acoustic array. We applied ray-tracing methods to the atmosphere using local meteorological observations to understand the short-distance propagation characteristics of infrasonic signals. Calculated infrasonic traveltime using a local meteorological model fits well with observed traveltime from a quarry. Local winds make possible infrasonic wave ducts in the lower atmosphere, and allow infrasonic wave arrival at short distances. Ray tracing using a local meteorological model has been used for the association between seismic and infrasonic signals.},

@inproceedings{Gainville2010,
abstract = {Using ray theory, long range propagation of infrasound through the atmosphere is modeled in the framework of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In atmospheric propagation, the high frequency hypothesis is based on the assumption that space and time scales of atmospheric properties (temperature, wind, density) are much larger than acoustic wave scales. An operational 3D nonlinear ray tracing code is developed to compute the temporal pressure signature at receivers. The global pressure signature at the receiver is the sum of eigenray contributions that link the source to the receiver. They are obtained by solving a generalized Burgers' equation along each eigenray taking into account nonlinear effects, shear and bulk viscosity absorption and molecular vibrational relaxation mechanisms. This equation is solved using a Fourier Galerkin spectral scheme. Specific developments are performed to pass through caustics and take into account ground reflection. The propagation of infrasound emitted by a motionless point source in a realistic atmosphere will illustrate the analysis. To quantify the validity limits of our approach, we investigate effects of the wind, atmospheric absorption, nonlinearities, refraction and scattering by small atmospheric scales on observed phase kinds, their travel time and their waveform. To estimate the nonlinearity effects relative to the linear dissipative effects we evaluate the Gol'dberg number. We note that nonlinear mechanisms are important to model the evolution of infrasonic waveform signatures. The 'N' and the 'U' measured waveform shape of, respectively, thermospheric and stratospheric paths are associated with nonlinear mechanisms. Nonlinearities are weak but the development of nonlinear models is necessary in order to characterize the source yield. Comparisons will be made with results available in the literature and recent numerical simulations based on Navier-Stokes equations.},

abstract = {Seismic interferometry involves the crosscorrelation of re- sponses at different receivers to obtain the Green's function be- tween these receivers. For the simple situation of an impulsive plane wave propagating along the x-axis, the crosscorrelation of the responses at two receivers along the x-axis gives the Green's function of the direct wave between these receivers. When the source function of the plane wave is a transient ?as in exploration seismology? or a noise signal ?as in passive seismology?, then the crosscorrelation gives the Green's function, convolved with the autocorrelation of the source function. Direct-wave interferome- try also holds for 2D and 3D situations, assuming the receivers are surrounded by a uniform distribution of sources. In this case, the main contributions to the retrieved direct wave between the receivers come from sources in Fresnel zones around stationary points. The main application of direct-wave interferometry is the retrieval of seismic surface-wave responses from ambient noise and the subsequent tomographic determination of the surface- wavevelocity distribution of the subsurface. Seismic interferom- etry is not restricted to retrieving direct waves between receivers. In a classic paper, Claerbout shows that the autocorrelation of the transmission response of a layered medium gives the plane-wave reflection response of that medium.This is essentially1Dreflect- ed-wave interferometry. Similarly, the crosscorrelation of the transmission responses, observed at two receivers, of an arbitrary inhomogeneous medium gives the 3D reflection response of that medium.One of the main applications of reflected-wave interfer- ometry is retrieving the seismic reflection response from ambient noise and imaging of the reflectors in the subsurface.Acommon aspect of direct- and reflected-wave interferometry is that virtual sources are created at positions where there are only receivers without requiring knowledge of the subsurface medium parame- ters or of the positions of the actual sources.},

abstract = {The most continuous and ubiquitous seismic signal on Earth is the microseism, closely related to ocean wave energy coupling with the solid Earth. A peculiar feature of microseism recorded in Antarctica is the link with the sea ice, making the temporal pattern of microseism amplitudes different with respect to the microseism recorded in low-middle latitude regions. Indeed, during austral winters, in Antarctica the oceanic waves cannot efficiently excite seismic energy because of the sea ice in the Southern Ocean. Here, we quantitatively investigate the relationship between microseism, recorded along the Antarctic coasts, and sea ice concentration. In particular, we show a decrease in sea ice sensitivity of microseism, due to the increasing distance from the station recording the seismic signal. The influence seems to strongly reduce for distances above 1,000 km. Finally, we present an algorithm, based on machine learning techniques, allowing to spatially and temporally reconstruct the sea ice distribution around Antarctica based on the microseism amplitudes. This technique will allow reconstructing the sea ice concentration in both Arctic and Antarctica in periods when the satellite images, routinely used for sea ice monitoring, are not available, with wide applications in many fields, first of all climate studies.},

Early recordings showed that, at low frequencies, there is relatively little intrinsic attenuation, facilitating the detection and characterization of large events over great ranges (e.g., Landau and Lifshitz 1959). Infrasound was used to locate enemy artillery in WWI. Infrasound was used as a monitoring tool during the early proliferation of nuclear weapon technologies after WWII when nuclear tests were routinely conducted in the atmosphere.

abstract = {For many aspects of numerical weather prediction it is important to have good error statistics. Here one can think of applications as diverse as data assimilation, model improvement, and medium-range forecasting. In this paper, a method for producing these statistics from a representative ensemble of forecast states at the appropriate forecast time is proposed and examined. To generate the ensemble, an attempt is made to simulate the process of error growth in a forecast model. For different ensemble members the uncertain elements of the forecasts are perturbed in different ways. First the authors attempt to obtain representative initial perturbations. For each perturbation, an independent 6-h assimilation cycle is performed. For this the available observations are randomly perturbed. The perturbed observations are input to the statistical interpolation assimilation scheme, giving a perturbed analysis. This analysis is integrated for 6 h with a perturbed version of the T63 forecast;model, using perturbed surface fields, to obtain a perturbed first guess for the next assimilation. After cycling for 4 days it was found that the ensemble statistics have become stable. To obtain perturbations to the model, different model options for the parameterization of horizontal diffusion, deep convection, radiation, gravity wave drag, and orography were selected. As part of the forecast error is due to model deficiencies, perturbing the model will lead to an improved ensemble forecast. This also creates the opportunity to use the ensemble forecast. for model sensitivity experiments. It is observed that the response, after several assimilation cycles, to the applied perturbations is strongly nonlinear. This fact makes it difficult to motivate the use of opposite initial perturbations. The spread in the ensemble of first-guess fields is validated against statistics available from the operational data assimilation scheme. It is seen that the spread in the ensemble is too small. Apparently, the simulation of the error sources is incomplete. In particular, we might have to generate less conventional perturbations to the model.},

Ground truth of the explosion was invoked to assess the accuracy of the location derived from infrasound data recorded over Western Europe. Different infrasonic phases were identified by using array-processing techniques and raytracing through atmospheric models. The analysis showed that the derived location was situated 13 km from the true location. The total area of the uncertainty ellipse, or area to be searched if the source was of unknown origin, was 690 km2. After the origin time and location, the yield was calculated by comparing infrasonic stratospheric amplitudes with those from a high-explosives dataset and was estimated at 40.9 tons high- explosives equivalent. In summary, this study illustrates the capability of seismic and infrasound data in forensic investigations. Furthermore, the potential of infrasound as a monitoring or verification technique is addressed.},

In this thesis, it is shown that infrasound can provide useful additional upper atmospheric observations in a region where data coverage is sparse; beyond the middle stratosphere direct information of wind is missing in current numerical weather prediction models. Passive ambient infrasound signals can act as an atmospheric probe. Observed and simulated infrasound wavefront parameters are compared, i.e., back azimuth, apparent velocity, or travel time. Wavefront parameters are extracted from the continuous waveform recordings using signal detectors and array processing techniques and simulated by ray theory using various atmospheric conditions. The theoretical basis of this method relies on the assertion that sound propagates through a particular atmospheric state. The state that is closest to reality will then lead to simulated values that are closest to the observed values. It is demonstrated that infrasound has the potential to contribute to operational weather prediction applications by validation of atmospheric analysis and forecast products, in particular in regions above 30 km altitude. In addition, knowledge of the dynamical stratosphere is utilized for infrasound monitoring, in order to benefit CTBT verification efforts.},

abstract = {The Navier–Stokes equations are solved using a finite-difference, time-domain (FDTD) approach for axi-symmetric environmental models, allowing three-dimensional acoustic propagation to be simulated using a two-dimensional Cylindrical coordinate system. A method to stabilize the FDTD algorithm in a viscous medium at atmospheric densities characteristic of the lower thermosphere is described. The stabilization scheme slightly alters the governing equations but results in quantifiable dispersion characteristics. It is shown that this method leaves sound speeds and attenuation unchanged at frequencies that are well resolved by the temporal sampling rate but strongly attenuates higher frequencies. Numerical experiments are performed to assess the effect of source strength on the amplitudes and spectral content of signals recorded at ground level at a range of distances from the source. It is shown that the source amplitudes have a stronger effect on a signal's dominant frequency than on its amplitude. Applying...},

@article{Wilson2005,
abstract = {We report here on infrasound signals observed using the infrasound microphone array at Fairbanks, Alaska that are apparently associated with the presence of pulsating auroras near the zenith. We have investigated the frequency domain coherence between the luminous intensity of the pulsating auroras and the high trace-velocity infrasound received at the earth's surface. Video data of the aurora display from an All-Sky video camera on the night of December 5, 2003 was compared with the pressure waveform data from the eight-microphone infrasonic array at Fairbanks. Enhanced coherence between the two signals was observed when a propagation delay time for the infrasound sample with respect to the video data sample was used. The frequency domain coherence was found to be high between the pulsating aurora intensity above the array and the high trace-velocity infrasound signals at the surface in the pass band from 0.03 to 0.08 Hz. Ray-tracing studies indicate that such high trace-velocity infrasound signals originate from sources within 35 km of the zenith above the array for a source height of 110 km. The presence of pulsating aurora patches within this area during the time interval of received infrasound and the high coherence between the video and infrasound data lead us to believe that periodic heating of the atmosphere by pulsating aurora is the actual source of the observed high trace-velocity infrasound.},

Newly corrected data from the remaining three systems generally corroborate this increase. Simple linear trend lines of the contemporary traffic noise (duration 6 to 12+ years) show that recent levels are slightly increasing, holding steady, or decreasing. These results confirm the prediction by Ross that the rate of increase in traffic noise would be far less at the end of the 20th century compared to that observed in the 1950s and 1960s.},

abstract = {Atmospheric infrasonic signals were classified on the basis of data obtained in the United States (University of Alaska, Fairbanks) and in the Antarctic region (Windless Bight) from 1980 to 1983. The data archive included five classes of signals from different sources: explosions, mountain associated waves, microbaroms, volcanic infrasound, and auroral infrasonic waves. This classification was based on the theory of testing statistical hypotheses. The possibilities of separating these classes were studied. It was shown that the signals (from the archive used) that are characteristic of explosions and volcanic activity can be rather easily separated from those characteristic of mountain associated waves, microbaroms, and auroral infrasonic waves. {\textcopyright} 2012 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

It is derived from first principles of physics (mass and momentum conservation) and an equation of state given by the fractional Zener stress-strain constitutive relation. For a derivative order $\alpha$ in the fractional Zener relation, the resulting absorption $\alpha$(k) obeys frequency power-laws as $\alpha$(k) ∝ $\omega$(1+$\alpha$) in a low-frequency regime, $\alpha$(k) ∝ $\omega$(1-$\alpha$/2) in an intermediate-frequency regime, and $\alpha$(k) ∝ $\omega$(1-$\alpha$) in a high-frequency regime. The value $\alpha$=1 corresponds to the case of a single relaxation process. The wave equation is causal for all frequencies. In addition the sound speed does not diverge as the frequency approaches infinity. This is an improvement over a previously published wave equation building on the fractional Kelvin-Voigt constitutive relation.},

International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasound array IS59 in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii recorded clear signals in close proximity of Hurricanes Felicia and Neki of 2009 for a first-hand investigation of the detailed source mechanism through a hindcast analysis. A spectral wave model describes the tropical cyclone and ambient sea states through a system of two-way nested grids with forcing from a blended data set of global, regional, and cyclonic winds. The computed wave conditions are validated with altimetry measurements and utilized in an acoustic model to estimate the intensity and spatial distribution of the microbarom source. The model results elucidate origins of infrasound signals from the tropical cyclone waves as well as their interactions with the ambient conditions consisting of swells, wind seas, and storm waves from nearby systems. The positive correlation between the IS59 observations and the theoretical microbarom estimates, and the saturation of recorded signals from high-energy sources support the use of infrasound signals for inference of tropical cyclone waves.},

Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) on board the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite temperature data and National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) temperature and wind data were use to investigate the dynamical effects of the unprecedented September 2002 SSW in the Antarctica stratosphere and MLT. The mean zonal wind (from SANAE HF radar) at the MLT shows reversal in approximately 7 days before the reversal at 10 hPa (from NCEP). This indicates that there was a downwards propagation of circulation disturbance. Westerly zonal winds dominate the winter MLT, but during the 2002 winter there were many periods of westward winds observed compared to other years. The dynamic spectrums of both meridional and zonal winds show presence of planetary waves (of {\~{}}14-day period) before the occurrence of the SSW.

We refer to this use of multiple-sampling coda waveforms as coda wave interferometry. We have exploited ultrasonic coda waves to monitor time-varying rock properties in a laboratory environment. We have studied the dependence of velocity on uniaxial stress in Berea sandstone, the temperature dependence of velocity in granite and in aluminum, and the change in velocity due to an increase of water saturation in sandstone.

@article{Donn1971,
abstract = {Summary For four years continuous recording of infrasonic signals in the frequency range 0.1 to 1 Hz, known as microbaroms, has been conducted at Palisades, New York. The microbaroms we recorded are radiated into the atmosphere by interfering ocean waves in the North Atlantic as far as 2000 km away. A characteristic diurnal variation in the amplitude of the received signal has been noted, independent of any variation in the source. We conclude that the variation is due to variations of the factors affecting atmospheric sound propagation, namely wind and temperature. In winter a semidiurnal variation in signal amplitude is observed, with maximum reception around 11 : 00 and 22; 00 local time. Reference to wind and temperature observations in the literature shows that at these times the lowest level of reflection of the vertically propagating signal occurs between 100 and 110 km due to the presence of strong east winds. At 18 : 00, time of minimum amplitudes, the reflection level rises to about 115 km because of a change in tidal wind phase. Viscous dissipation associated with the changed reflection height can account for the observed signal weakening. A third maximum, a less regular effect, is found to be related to more variable winds between 95 and 105 km. In summer, reflection is found to occur from about 50 km due to the presence of stratospheric easterlies. The summer diurnal variation, different from that of the winter, exhibits only a weak minimum about 20 : 00. This appears to result from a diurnal temperature variation superimposed on a diurnal wind variation. Abnormally high microbaroms were recorded at times that can be related to an atmospheric event known as a stratospheric warming. Microbaroms thus provide a continuously available natural mechanism for probing the upper atmosphere. We conclude that the establishment of microbarom observation systems could give a comprehensive technique for monitoring several upper atmospheric parameters.},

@article{Chao1985a,
abstract = {In this conceptual and numerical study, sudden stratospheric warmings (SSW) are identified as catastrophes. A catastrophe is the transition toward a separate new equilibrium after the original stable equilibrium state of a dynamical system terminates as an external parameter changes smoothly and slowly across a critical value. Many qualitative results of some previous modeling studies of SSW are interpreted in light of catastrophe theory. For example, the cutoff amplitudes in wave forcing as functions of initial conditions determined by Holton and Dunkerton are shown to be in the loci of unstable equilibria in a bifurcation diagram. Also the stage of warmest polar temperature represents the peak of the overshooting in a catastrophe. Moreover, the rapid restoration of westerlies corresponds to the return from the overshooting. Basic concepts in catastrophe theory related to SSW-for example, hysteresis, cusp and triggering-are demonstrated in a numerical study using the HoltonMass model. The transition from the steady regime to the vacillation regime in the Holton-Mass model, i.e., SSW, is explained conceptually in terms of the topographically induced Rossby wave instability. The multiple equilibria involved owe their existence to the resonant response of the system to bottom forcing. The suddenness of SSW is due to the resonant increase of wave amplitude and its positive feedback on the mean flow. The model, as well as the conceptual explanation, gives a resonant buildup of the planetary wave, followed quickly by its decay and then by the warming peak. a scenario corresponding well with observations. A surge of wave amplitude at upper tropospheric level.s prior to the warming peak is a result of the instability and, as such, should not be used as a trigger to{\textperiodcentered} instigate SSW as in many previous mechanistic models. Implications of the catastrophic nature of SSW for simulation and forecasting efforts are discussed. An additional and perhaps more difficult challenge in the SSW forecasting effort comes when the initial planetary wave amplitude is not yet in the rapid building-up phase; i.e., before the instability occurs.},

abstract = {Summary. Observations of surface waves crossing ocean basins indicate that, at least in some cases, a better interpretation of what was previously considered to be the simultaneous arrival of fundamental Love and second Rayleigh modes, with similar group velocities, is the coupled motion of the second‐generalized mode surface wave propagating in an anisotropic upper‐mantle. This mode displays the polarization anomalies expected from anisotropic alignments caused by syntectonic recrystallization of olivine in a zone of horizontal shear. The polarity of the pattern of anomalies, found in waves crossing the Pacific Basin, suggests that the lithosphere is dragging the asthenosphere. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1981, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {Oceanic pressure measurements, even in very deep water, and atmospheric pressure or seismic records, from anywhere on Earth, contain noise with dominant periods between 3 and 10 s, which is believed to be excited by ocean surface gravity waves. Most of this noise is explained by a nonlinear wave–wave interaction mechanism, and takes the form of surface gravity waves, acoustic or seismic waves. Previous theoretical work on seismic noise focused on surface (Rayleigh) waves, and did not consider finite-depth effects on the generating wave kinematics. These finite-depth effects are introduced here, which requires the consideration of the direct wave-induced pressure at the ocean bottom, a contribution previously overlooked in the context of seismic noise. That contribution can lead to a considerable reduction of the seismic noise source, which is particularly relevant for noise periods larger than 10 s. The theory is applied to acoustic waves in the atmosphere, extending previous theories that were limited to vertical propagation only. Finally, the noise generation theory is also extended beyond the domain of Rayleigh waves, giving the first quantitative expression for sources of seismic body waves. In the limit of slow phase speeds in the ocean wave forcing, the known and well-verified gravity wave result is obtained, which was previously derived for an incompressible ocean. The noise source of acoustic, acoustic-gravity and seismic modes are given by a mode-specific amplification of the same wave-induced pressure field near zero wavenumber.},

abstract = {It has recently been suggested that observations of neu- tral density from satellite accelerometer data indicate a strong cooling occurred in the upper thermosphere during the January 2009 sudden stratospheric warming (SSW). The 2009 warming was a major event with winter polar stratospheric temperatures increasing by 70 K. This January period has been re‐examined with three independent mod- els: the NRLMSISE‐00 empirical model; the physics‐based coupled thermosphere, ionosphere, plasmasphere, electrody- namics model (CTIPe); and the whole atmosphere model (WAM). The analysis of this period and comparison with the neutral density observations reveals that there is, in fact, no evidence at any latitude for a large‐scale or global decrease in upper thermosphere density or temperature in response to the SSW. The observed decrease in density and temperature can be amply accounted for by small changes in geomagnetic activity during this period. On the contrary, the WAM numerical simulations of the period suggest a possible small globally averaged upper thermosphere warming and neutral density increase by 5{\%} during the SSW. This warming would have been difficult to discern in the local‐time sam- pling of the CHAMP observations due to likely change in the diurnal density variation during the SSW, and due to a much larger contribution to the variability from geomagnetic sources. At this stage, therefore, it is not possible to ascertain if a cooling or warming occurred in the upper thermosphere in response to the stratospheric warming.},

abstract = {Most large (over a kilometre in diameter) near-Earth asteroids are now known, but recognition that airbursts (or fireballs resulting from nuclear-weapon-sized detonations of meteoroids in the atmosphere) have the potential to do greater damage than previously thought has shifted an increasing portion of the residual impact risk (the risk of impact from an unknown object) to smaller objects. Above the threshold size of impactor at which the atmosphere absorbs sufficient energy to prevent a ground impact, most of the damage is thought to be caused by the airburst shock wave, but owing to lack of observations this is uncertain. Here we report an analysis of the damage from the airburst of an asteroid about 19metres (17 to 20metres) in diameter southeast of Chelyabinsk, Russia, on 15 February 2013, estimated to have an energy equivalent of approximately 500(±100) kilotons of trinitrotoluene (TNT, where 1 kiloton of TNT = 4.185×1012 joules). We show that a widely referenced technique of estimating airburst damage does not reproduce the observations, and that the mathematical relations based on the effects of nuclear weaponsalmost always used with this techniqueoverestimate blast damage. This suggests that earlier damage estimates near the threshold impactor size are too high. We performed a global survey of airbursts of a kiloton or more (including Chelyabinsk), and find that the number of impactors with diameters of tens of metres may be an order of magnitude higher than estimates based on other techniques. This suggests a non-equilibrium (if the population were in a long-term collisional steady state the size-frequency distribution would either follow a single power law or there must be a size-dependent bias in other surveys) in the near-Earth asteroid population for objects 10 to 50metres in diameter, and shifts more of the residual impact risk to these sizes.},

abstract = {The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) operates a three-dimensional microbarometer array at the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research observatory. The array consists of five microbarometers on a meteorological tower up to an altitude of 200 m. Ten ground-based microbarometers surround the tower with an array aperture of 800 m. This unique setup allows for the study of infrasound propagation in three dimensions. The added value of the vertical dimension is the sensitivity to wind and temperature in the atmospheric boundary layer over multiple altitudes. In this study, we analyze infrasound generated by an accidental chemical explosion at the Moerdijk petrochemical plant on 3 June 2014. The recordings of the tower microbarometers show two sequential arrivals, whereas the recordings on the ground show one wavefront. This arrival structure is interpreted to be the upgoing and downgoing wavefronts. The observations are compared with propagation modeling results using global-scale and mesoscale atmospheric models. Independent temperature and wind measurements, which are available at the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research, are used for comparison with model output. The modeling results explain the signal arrival times; however, the tower wavefront arrivals are not explained. This study is important for understanding the influence of the atmospheric boundary layer on infrasound detections and propagation.},

Data from nine University of Utah Seismograph Stations infrasonic arrays are supplemented by three additional arrays in Nevada, operated by Southern Methodist University. The detection procedure using an adaptive F-detector provides input into the Bayesian Infrasonic Source Location procedure. The catalog consists of 1510 events with indication of repeated events from many locations such as Dugway Testing Ground, Utah Test and Training Range, and New Bomb. We analyzed the relationship between seasonal variations in the event locations and wind conditions using the Ground-to-Space specifications based on publicly available operational numerical weather prediction data analysis products supplement by empirical models above 80 km. There is significant commonality between this study's bulletin and the Western United States Infrasonic Catalog published by Walker et al. (2011). A previous study utilized infrasound signals detected on the USArray Transportable Array seismic stations (2007–2008). Both results document the vast majority of events that occur during working hours, suggesting a human cause. To illustrate the utility of the event bulletin for exploring atmospheric dynamics, propagation paths of an event detected during the equinox period, when the stratospheric wind is low, were generated using a ray-tracing algorithm. We found that the observations contain stratospheric arrivals, not predicted by ray theory, possibly due to gravity waves increasing the effective jet speed.},

abstract = {Computing and numerical modeling have become such an important part of almost every scientific field, including oceanography, that it must be nearly impossible for a young person coming into the field today to imagine the precomputer era. Then as now, most physical oceanographers were concerned with the exploration of the oceans through measurements. There also existed a small group of theorists, and a few remarkable individuals with a foot in both camps, like Harrold Sverdrup, Walter Munk, and Henry Stommel. After a long incubation period numerical models of ocean circulation have now evolved into a third element in oceanographic research, partially bridging the gap between theory and observations and forming links with related disciplines. The original impetus for developing ocean models came from outside the oceanographic research community. As far back as the 1920s L. F. Richardson (1922) had a vision of mathematical models of the Earth's climate that would include the atmosphere, ocean, land surface, and cryosphere. Richardson recognized that many gaps existed in the basic understanding of the climate system essential for such an endeavor. As he put it , "We are forced to occupy a house which is still in the hands of the builders. " Modelers are still in this uncomfortable position today. However, climate modelers and field workers studying basic processes are now recognizing the benefits of close collaboration to fill in the gaps. When Richardson wrote his book, Weather Prediction by Numerical Process, there were no computers powerful enough to carry out the calculations he envisioned. Even if they had been available, there was a lack of knowledge of the branch of mathematics required to use computers to model the circulation of the ocean and atmosphere. Research during World War II gave the impetus to the development of computers and pioneering work began on numerical weather forecasting led by John von Neumann and Jules Charney at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS). Joseph Smagorinsky (Figure 3.1), who had been a staff member at the IAS, returned to the U.S. Weather Bureau with the ambitious goal of reviving Richardson's vision of a mathematical model of the entire climate system, using what had been learned in numerical weather forecasting as basic building blocks. Ocean circulation models are critically dependent on computer technology. Computer resources available to ocean modelers are still not adequate to fully resolve the wide spectrum of time and space scales of the ocean circulation. It is not possible to say after more than four decades since work began that ocean models are mature. For reasons that will be made clear there is still much work to do. This brief account will only be concerned with the three decades between 1960 and 1990. I have associated these three decades with the birth, infancy, and adolescence of ocean general circulation models (OGCMs), recognizing that the maturity of ocean models is still some time off, perhaps in the middle decades of the twenty-first century. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc., All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The 2008 Plinian eruptions of Kasatochi and Okmok volcanoes were recorded by six remote International Monitoring System infrasound arrays. High-amplitude infrasound at these stations, combined with remote sensing, permits insight into important volcanic source parameters, such as origin times, durations, and source characteristics. Infrasound from the 7–8 August Kasatochi eruption consists of three well-defined eruption pulses, with the first two steam-rich and the last ash-rich. Pulse 2 is the most energetic and impulsive. Okmok produced over 9 h of continuous infrasound on 12–13 July. Acoustic propagation modeling for the Okmok eruption and first Kasatochi pulse predict thermospheric ducting and origin times consistent with seismic and satellite observations. However, theoretical acoustic origin times of pulses 2–3 are predicted to occur ∼15 min earlier than the seismic. Stratospheric ducting for these later pulses provides more consistent origin times. Although both volcanoes ejected ash into the stratosphere ({\textgreater}15 km), Kasatochi produced higher amplitude infrasound than Okmok. Previous studies have shown sustained infrasound with frequencies {\textless}0.5 Hz is indicative of high-altitude ash emissions. Kasatochi and Okmok recordings are consistent with this, as stratospheric emissions evident in satellite imagery are correlated with sustained 0.01–0.5 Hz infrasound. Further, the acoustic spectrum shape resembles the spectrum from man-made jets, suggesting a self-similar noise generation mechanism proposed in earlier work. Although uncertainties exist, observations and propagation modeling from Kasatochi suggest self-similarity is apparent at long distances ({\textgreater}2000 km) and does not seem to be appreciably affected by changes in ash content between the eruption pulses.},

abstract = {The cross correlation of ambient signal allows seismologists to collect data even in the absence of seismic events. “Seismic interferometry” shows that the cross correlation of simultaneous recordings of a random wavefield made at two locations is formally related to the impulse response between those locations. This idea has found many applications in seismology, as a growing number of dense seismic networks become available: cross-correlating long seismic records, the Green's function between instrument pairs is “reconstructed” and used, just like the seismic recording of an explosion, in tomography, monitoring, etc. These applications have been accompanied by theoretical investigations of the relationship between noise cross correlation and the Green's function; numerous formulations of “ambient noise” theory have emerged, each based on different hypotheses and/or analytical approaches. The purpose of this study is to present most of those approaches together, providing a comprehensive overview of the theory. Understanding the specific hypotheses behind each Green's function recipe is critical to its correct application. Hoping to guide nonspecialists who approach ambient noise theory for the first time, we treat the simplest formulation (the stationary-phase approximation applied to smooth unbounded media) in detail.We then move on to more general treatments, illustrating that the “stationary-phase” and “reciprocity theorem” approaches lead to the same formulae when applied to the same scenario.We show that a formal cross correlation/Green's function relationship can be found in complex, bounded media and for nonuniform source distributions.We finally provide the bases for understanding howthe Green's function is reconstructed in the presence of scattering obstacles.},

abstract = {The ability of the InternationalMonitoring System (IMS) infrasound network to detect atmospheric nuclear explosions and other signals of interest is strongly dependent on stationspecific ambient noise. This ambient noise includes both incoherent wind noise and real coherent infrasonic waves. Previous ambient infrasound noise models have not distinguished between incoherent and coherent components. We present a first attempt at statistically and systematically characterizing coherent infrasound recorded by the IMS. We perform broadband (0.01-5Hz) array processing with the IMS continuous waveform archive (39 stations from 1 April 2005 to 31 December 2010) using an implementation of the Progressive Multi-Channel Correlation algorithm in logfrequency space. From these results, we estimate multi-year 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of the RMS pressure of coherent signals in 15 frequency bands for each station. We compare the resulting coherent infrasound models with raw power spectral density noise models, which inherently include both incoherent and coherent components. Our results indicate that IMS arrays consistently record coherent ambient infrasound across the broad frequency range from 0.01 to 5Hz when wind noise levels permit. The multi-year averaging emphasizes continuous signals such as oceanic microbaroms, as well as persistent transient signals such as repetitive volcanic, surf, thunder, or anthropogenic activity. Systematic characterization of coherent infrasound detection is important for quantifying a station's recording environment, signal-to-noise ratio as a function of frequency and direction, and overall performance, which all influence the detection probability of specific signals of interest. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Fundamental mode Rayleigh waves generally show retrograde particle motion at the surface of the Earth. If there exists a thick sedimentary layer, however, reversal of the sign of vertical eigenfunction occurs near the surface, resulting in prograde Rayleigh-wave particle motion at the surface. We show that, for structures similar to those found in the Los Angeles basin (with thickness up to 8 km), surface prograde motion may occur within the frequency band 0.05-0.3 Hz. Although it has been suggested that the effect of gravity on waves in unconsolidated surface layer may be important, partitioning of energy between the elatic and gravitational energy shows that the gravitational energy is less than 1 per cent and thus is not important. The phenomenon is caused by elastic effects, mainly caused by extremely slow shallow seismic velocities. Observation of prograde elliptical particle motion may be difficult, however, because particle motion is largely horizontal and high microseismic noise exists in the same frequency band. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

abstract = {A bright bolide appeared over the Netherlands on the evening of 2003, February 19. Infrasound generated by this bolide was detected at two nearby infrasound arrays as two distinct events. The origins of the infrasonic signals were located in the stratosphere at heights of 30 and 57 km. The results were obtained independently of visual observations of the bolide but confirm the reported time of occurrence. The ability to distinguish between a moving and static source is crucial for the application of infrasound as a monitoring technique. This study also illustrates the dependence of the infrasound technique on signal coherency, inter-array distance and atmospheric knowledge.},

abstract = {The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) dominates the variability of the equatorial stratosphere ({\&}{\#}8764;16{\&}{\#}8211;50 km) and is easily seen as downward propagating easterly and westerly wind regimes, with a variable period averaging approximately 28 months. From a fluid dynamical perspective, the QBO is a fascinating example of a coherent, oscillating mean flow that is driven by propagating waves with periods unrelated to that of the resulting oscillation. Although the QBO is a tropical phenomenon, it affects the stratospheric flow from pole to pole by modulating the effects of extratropical waves. Indeed, study of the QBO is inseparable from the study of atmospheric wave motions that drive it and are modulated by it. The QBO affects variability in the mesosphere near 85 km by selectively filtering waves that propagate upward through the equatorial stratosphere, and may also affect the strength of Atlantic hurricanes. The effects of the QBO are not confined to atmospheric dynamics. Chemical constituents, such as ozone, water vapor, and methane, are affected by circulation changes induced by the QBO. There are also substantial QBO signals in many of the shorter-lived chemical constituents. Through modulation of extratropical wave propagation, the QBO has an effect on the breakdown of the wintertime stratospheric polar vortices and the severity of high-latitude ozone depletion. The polar vortex in the stratosphere affects surface weather patterns, providing a mechanism for the QBO to have an effect at the Earth's surface. As more data sources (e.g., wind and temperature measurements from both ground-based systems and satellites) become available, the effects of the QBO can be more precisely assessed. This review covers the current state of knowledge of the tropical QBO, its extratropical dynamical effects, chemical constituent transport, and effects of the QBO in the troposphere ({\&}{\#}8764;0{\&}{\#}8211;16 km) and mesosphere ({\&}{\#}8764;50{\&}{\#}8211;100 km). It is intended to provide a broad overview of the QBO and its effects to researchers outside the field, as well as a source of information and references for specialists. The history of research on the QBO is discussed only briefly, and the reader is referred to several historical review papers. The basic theory of the QBO is summarized, and tutorial references are provided.},

@article{Longuet-Higgins1950,
abstract = {In the past it has been considered unlikely that ocean waves are capable of generating microseismic oscillations of the sea bed over areas of deep water, since the decrease of the pressure variations with depth is exponential, according to the first-order theory generally used. However, it was recently shown by Miche that in the second approximation to the standing wave there is a second-order pressure variation which is not attenuated with depth and which must therefore ultimately predominate over the first-order pressure variations. In section section 2 and 3 of the present paper the general conditions under which second-order pressure variations of this latter type will occur are considered. It is shown that in an infinite wave train there is in general a second-order pressure variation at infinite depth which is applied equally over the whole fluid and is associated with no particle motion. In the case of two progressive waves of the same wave-length travelling in opposite directions this pressure variation is proportional to the product of the (first-order) amplitudes of the two waves and is of twice their frequency. The pressure variation at infinite depth is found to be closely related to changes in the potential energy of the wave train as a whole. By introducing the two-dimensional frequency spectrum of the motion it is shown that in the general case variations in the mean pressure over a wide area only occur when the spectrum contains wave groups of the same wave-length travelling in opposite directions. (These are called opposite wave groups.) In section 4 the effect of the compressibility of the water is considered by evaluating the motion of an opposite pair of waves in a heavy compressible fluid to the second order of approximation. In place of the pressure variation at infinite depth, waves of compression are set up, and there is resonance between the bottom and the free surface when the depth of water is about ({\$}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}n + {\$}\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}4{\}}{\$}) times the length of a compression wave (n being an integer). The motion in a surface layer whose thickness is of the order of the length of a Stokes wave is otherwise unaffected by the compressibility. Section 5 is devoted to the question whether the second-order pressure variations in surface waves are capable of generating microseisms of the observed order of magnitude. By considering the displacement of the sea bed due to a concentrated force at the upper surface of the water it is shown that the effect of resonance will be to increase the disturbance by a factor of the order of 5 over its value in shallow water. The results of section section 3 and 4 are used to derive an expression for the vertical displacement of the ground in terms of the frequency characteristics of the waves. The displacement from a storm area of 1000 sq.km. is estimated to be of the order of 6{\$}\backslashcdot {\$}5{\$}\backslashmu {\$}, at a distance of 2000 km. Ocean waves may therefore be the cause of microseisms, provided that there is interference between groups of waves of the same frequency travelling in opposite directions. Suitable conditions of wave interference may occur at the centre of a cyclonic depression or possibly if there is wave reflexion from a coast. In the latter case the microseisms are likely to be smaller, except perhaps locally. Confirmation of the present theory is provided by the observations of Bernard and Deacon, who discovered independently that the period of the microseisms is in many cases about half that of the ocean waves associated with them.},

abstract = {Instrumental timing and phase errors are a notorious problem in seismic data acquisition and processing. These can be frequency independent, for example due to clock drift, but may also be frequency dependent, for example due to imperfectly known instrument responses. A technique is presented that allows both types of errors to be recovered in a systematic fashion. The methodology relies on the time-symmetry usually inherent in time-averaged cross-correlations of ambient seismic noise: the difference between the arrival time of the direct surface-wave at positive time and the arrival time of the direct surface-wave at negative time is quantified. Doing this for all eligible receiver–receiver pairs of a large-N seismic array, including one or more receivers devoid of instrumental timing errors, the instrumental timing errors of all incorrectly timed receivers can be determined uniquely. Most notably, this is accomplished by means of a weighted least-squares inversion. The weights are based on the receiver–receiver distances and decrease the adverse effect of inhomogeneities in the noise illumination pattern on the recovered instrumental timing errors. Inversion results are furthermore optimized by limiting the inversion to receiver couples that (i) exceed a specific receiver–receiver distance threshold and (ii) whose time-averaged cross-correlations exceed a specific signal-to-noise ratio threshold. Potential frequency dependence of the timing errors is incorporated by means of an iterative, frequency-dependent approach. The proposed methodology is validated using synthetic recordings of ambient seismic surface-wave noise due to an arbitrary non-uniform illumination pattern. The methodology is successfully applied to time-averaged cross-correlations of field recordings of ambient seismic noise on and around the Reykjanes peninsula, SW Iceland.},

The derivation assumes that the characteristic length scale and characteristic time scale for the ambient medium are larger than the corresponding scales for the acoustic disturbance. For such a circumstance, it is argued that accumulative effects of inhomogeneities and the ambient unsteadiness are satisfactorily taken into account by a wave equation that is correct to first order in the derivatives of the ambient quantities. A derivation that consistently neglects second‐ and higher‐order terms leads to a concise wave equation similar to the familiar ordinary wave equation of acoustics. The wide applicability of this equation is established by showing that it reduces to previously known wave equations for special cases and by showing, with the eikonal approximation, that it yields the geometrical acoustics equations for ray propagation in moving inhomogeneous media.},

Temperatures near the edge of the Antarctic polar vortex were considerably warmer than normal over the entire course of the winter. The polar night jet was considerably weaker than normal and was displaced more poleward than has been observed in previous winters. These record high temperatures and weak jet resulted from a series of wave events that took place over the course of the winter. The propagation of these wave events from the troposphere is diagnosed from time series of Eliassen–Palm flux vectors and autoregression time series. Strong levels of planetary waves were observed in the midlatitude lower troposphere. The combinations of strong tropospheric waves with a low index of refraction at the tropopause resulted in the large stratospheric wave forcing. The wave events tended to occur irregularly over the course of the winter, and the cumulative effect of these wave...},

abstract = {Sound becomes inaudible if it consists of frequencies lower than 20 Hz, i.e. the human hearing threshold, and is called infrasound. Low frequency acoustic signals were first discovered after the eruption of the Krakatoa (Indonesia) in 1883. Due to its low frequency content, this infrasound traveled up to seven times around the globe while reaching altitudes over 100 kilometer. The ability to detect explosions with infrasound resulted in substantial scientific and societal interest during World War I and the era of atmospheric nuclear testing. This interest diminished as nuclear tests were confined to the underground under the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963. Recently, with the signature of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, infrasound gained renewed attention as it is being used as a verification technique. This thesis describes the complete sequence of measuring, processing and interpreting infrasound data. A microbarometer was developed and deployed in arrays to measure infrasound. Array processing and statistical detection techniques are applied to extract signals of interest from the continuous recordings. Knowledge on the atmospheric propagation appeared essential in identifying infrasonic sources, like meteors, volcanoes, sea waves and accidental chemical explosions. A large amount of coherent infrasound is continuously being detected from both natural and man-made sources, i.e. the inaudible symphony. Applications are foreseen in acoustic remote sensing where infrasound can be used as passive probe for the upper atmosphere. Non-acoustic phenomena, like gravity waves, can also be detected with the methods described in this thesis.},

Currently, 60 infrasound arrays are being installed to monitor the atmosphere for nuclear tests as part of the International Monitoring System (IMS). The number of non-IMS arrays also increases worldwide. The experimental ARCES infrasound array (ARCI) is an example of such an initiative. The detectability of infrasound differs for each array and is a function of the array location and configuration, the state of the atmosphere, and the presence of natural and anthropogenic sources. In this study, a year of infrasound data is analyzed as recorded by ARCI. Contributions of the atmosphere and the sources are evaluated in both a low- (0.1–1.0 Hz) and high-frequency (1.0–7.0 Hz) pass-band. The enormous number of detections in the low-frequency band is explained in terms of the stratospheric wind and ocean wave activity and compared with the detection of microseism. Understanding the detectability in the low-frequency band is of utmost importance for successfully applying infrasound as a verification technique since small-sized nuclear test will show up in this frequency range.},

However, coherent energy from powerful swells may overcome the wind-carried microbarom signals and arrive to the station through thermospheric ducting.

abstract = {The frequency–wavenumber (fk) and Capon methods are widely used in seismic array studies of background or ambient noise to infer the backazimuth and slowness of microseismic sources. We present an implementation of these techniques for the analysis of microseisms (0.05–2 Hz) which draws on array signal processing literature from a range of disciplines. The presented techniques avoid frequency mixing in the cross-power spectral density and therefore yield an accurate slowness vector estimation of the incoming seismic waves. Using synthetic data, we show explicitly how the frequency averaged broad-band approach can result in a slowness-shifted spectrum. The presented implementation performs the slowness estimations individually for each frequency bin and sums the resulting slowness spectra over a specific frequency range. This may be termed an incoherently averaged signal, or IAS, approach. We further modify the method through diagonal loading to ensure a robust solution. The synthetic data show good agreement between the analytically derived and inferred error in slowness. Results for real (observed) data are compared between the approximate and IAS methods for two different seismic arrays. The IAS method results in the improved resolution of features, particularly for the Capon spectrum, and enables, for instance, Rg and Lg arrivals from similar backazimuths to be separated in the case of real data.},

abstract = {Correlations of random seismic noise are now widely used to retrieve the Green's function between two points. Whereas this technique provides useful results in tomography and monitoring studies, it is mainly limited by an uneven distribution of noise sources. In that case, theoretical requirements are not completely fulfilled and we may wonder how reliable the reconstructed signals are, in particular for the purpose of estimating traveltime from correlations. This study finds a way to quantify effects of a nonisotropic noise field by estimating the arrival-time error resulting from a particular nonisotropic distribution of recorded wave intensity. Our study is based on a theoretical prediction of this bias and we successfully test the theory by comparing the theoretical expectation to real measurements from seismic-prospecting data. In particular, we distinguish between the effects of source distribution and the effects of medium heterogeneity between the sources and the region of receivers. We find relat...},

abstract = {Explosive submarine volcanic processes are poorly understood, due to the difficulties associated with both direct observation and continuous monitoring. In this study hydroacoustic, infrasound, and seismic signals recorded during the May 2010 submarine eruption of South Sarigan seamount, Marianas Arc, are used to construct a detailed event chronology. The signals were recorded on stations of the International Monitoring System, which is a component of the verification measures for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Numerical hydroacoustic and infrasound propagation modelling confirms that viable propagation paths from the source to receivers exist, and provide traveltimes allowing signals recorded on the different technologies to be associated. The eruption occurred in three stages, separated by three-hour periods of quiescence. 1) A 46. h period during which broadband impulsive hydroacoustic signals were generated in clusters lasting between 2 and 13. min. 95{\%} of the 7602 identified events could be classified into 4 groups based on their waveform similarity. The time interval between clusters decreased steadily from 80 to 25. min during this period. 2) A five-hour period of 10. Hz hydroacoustic tremor, interspersed with large-amplitude, broadband signals. Associated infrasound signals were also recorded at this time. 3) An hour-long period of transient broadband events culminated in two large-amplitude hydroacoustic events and one broadband infrasound signal. A speculative interpretation, consistent with the data, suggests that during phase (1) transitions between endogenous dome growth and phreatomagmatic explosions occurred with the magma ascent rate accelerating throughout the period; during phase (2) continuous venting of fragmented magma occurred, and was powerful enough to breach the sea surface. During the climactic phase (3) discrete powerful explosions occurred, and sufficient seawater was vaporised to produce the contemporaneous 12. km altitude steam plume. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Plants of Dianthus carthusianorum from a calamine (zinc–lead) waste heap and from unpolluted stands were compared in the field and under controlled laboratory conditions. It was found that the waste-heap plants differed significantly from those in the normal population in respect to the following morphological traits: lower weight of aerial parts, shorter and narrower leaves, smaller number of leaves per plant. In combination with shorter, less numerous shoots, these features reduce the transpiration area of the plants. The general habit (predominance of forms with short and trailing shoots) of the waste-heap population points to adaptation to a xeric environment. Under controlled conditions all of the above traits were maintained through three successive generations. They are thus genetically controlled. Root tolerance tests showed that the waste-heap plants had higher tolerance to zinc and lead. These results indicate that strong selection processes have generated a clear ecotypical differentiation for heavy metal tolerance and drought tolerance in a zinc–lead-rich waste-heap population of D. carthusianorum (variety).},

abstract = {A simple coupled ocean–atmosphere model, similar to that of Zebiak and Cane, is used to examine the dynamic and thermodynamic processes associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The model is run for 300 years. The interannual variability which results is regular, with a period of either 3 or 4 years, quantized by the annual cycle. The amplitude (∼1.5 m s−1 wind and 2°C SST anomalies), period and structure of the interannual variability compare well with observations. The model warm event is initiated in the spring prior to the event peak, and is well described as an instability of the coupled system. During instability growth, the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly is primarily generated by vertical upwelling processes. The SST anomaly can be approximately described by the expression ∂T/∂t = KTh − $\alpha$*T, where T is the SST anomaly, t time, h the upper layer thickness (pycnocline) perturbation and $\alpha$* an effective damping time which includes heat loss to the atmosphere. KT parameterizes vertical upwelling and mixed layer processes. Oceanic wave dynamics determines the fate of the growing instability. The warming of the SST produces westerly wind anomalies in the equator central Pacific, forcing equatorially trapped Rossby waves that propagate freely to the western boundary. These waves reflect at the western boundary, sending upwelling equatorial Kelvin waves back to the central basin. These cooling Kelvin waves act to terminate instability growth and rapidly plunge the coupled system into a cold regime. The western boundary reflection is necessary for event termination. The system returns from a cold regime via reduced heat flux to the atmosphere and, to a lesser extent, by wave induced processes like that which lead to the warm event termination. The interannual variability is not produced by vacillation between two equilibrium states: a cold and a warm state. The growth rate to either the cold or warm state is too slow for the system to achieve equilibrium, even for a basin the size of the Pacific. The model results indicate that shortly after the initial set of gravest mode Rossby reflections on the western boundary, the instability growth is already being substantially moderated by the equatorial wave processes in the ocean. Thus the system is oscillatory around a single basic state. Of the Rossby waves produced in the central Pacific by the warm event, only the two gravest mode symmetric modes are important in the reflection process, which produce the Kelvin waves that terminate the warm event. In nature, the actual western boundary for the equatorial Pacific wave guide is very ambiguous. Calculations indicate, however, that efficient reflection of the gravest symmetric Rossby waves from a more realistic boundary than the meridional wall in the model is possible. Finally, if the model is indeed simulating the correct processes controlling ENSO events, the nature of the instability mechanism that leads to growth and the wave-induced termination of the model warm event suggests that, for realistic instability growth rates for the coupled equatorial ocean-atmosphere system, interannual variability analogous to ENSO should not be possible in equatorial basins significantly smaller than the Pacific.},

A unified representation for Green's function retrieval by MDD is proposed. From this representation, it follows that the traditional crosscorrelation method gives a Green's function of which the source is smeared in space and time. This smearing is quantified by a space–time point-spread function (PSF), which can be retrieved from measurements at an array of receivers. MDD removes this PSF and thus deblurs and deghosts the source of the Green's function obtained by correlation.},

abstract = {Microseisms recorded at Palisades, New York are investigated as to the source location, propagation paths, and relation to ocean wave heights. The source location is estimated from analysis of the incoming wave ground motion by using an analog correlator to compute the direction of propagation and then tracing this ray to a suspected meteorological‐oceanographic source. The propagation path of Rayleigh waves approaching Palisades is determined, taking into account the geological and bathymetric structure of the western North Atlantic, and the resulting ray diagram is used to explain some of the source frequency observations. The amplitude of observed microseisms is shown to be a function of the ocean wave heights in the suspected generating region and is a result of both refraction effects as well as apparently ‘off the continental shelf' source locations. The principal conclusions are as follows: (1) The majority of sources producing microseisms at Palisades occur either in regions on the continental shelf to the east and northeast or off the continental shelf to the southeast, although the latter produce weaker signals. (2) The relative lack of sources in the region along the southeast coast on the continental shelf appears to be due to refraction effects. (3) The closer the origin is to the east or northeast on the continental shelf, the higher are the microseisms produced by given ocean waves although the relationship has too much scatter to allow ocean wave heights to be determined with great enough certainty from microseism observations.},

abstract = {A vapor cloud explosion occurred at an oil depot near Buncefield in the UK in 2005. Three infrasound arrays in the Netherlands detected various stratospheric phases. Some of these phases appeared with celerities, i.e., horizontal propagation velocity, in the conventional range of 0.28 to 0.31 km/s. Exceptionally fast arrivals, infrasonic forerunners, were identified with celerities of 0.31 to 0.36 km/s. These phases could be explained by head-wave-like propagation in a high velocity acoustic channel between 40 and 50 km height, where stratospheric zonal winds reached values of 120 m/s. The manifestation of infrasonic forerunners is validated by modeling with raytracing through actual atmospheric models and determining the celerity, apparent velocity and back azimuth. One phase occurred with a celerity of 0.25 km/s. Hence, we propose a new celerity range for fast stratospheric phases of 0.31 to 0.36 km/s and to lower the limit of the conventional range to 0.25 km/s.},

abstract = {Some numerical solutions of acoustic propagation problems using linearized Euler equations are studied. The two-dimensional Euler equations are linearized around a known stationary mean ow. The computed solution is obtained by using a dispersion-relation-preserving scheme in space, combined with a fourth-order Runge–Kutta algorithm in time. This numerical integration leads to very good results in terms of accuracy, stability, and low storage. The implementation of source terms in these equations is studied very carefully in various con gurations, inasmuch as the nal goal is to improve and to validate the stochastic noise generation and radiation model. In this approach, the turbulent velocity eld is modeled by a sum of random Fourier modes through a source term in the linearized Euler equations to predict the noise from subsonic ows. The radiation of a point source in a subsonic and a supersonic uniform mean ow is investigated. The numerical estimates are shown to be in excellent agreement with the analytical solutions. Then, the emphasis is on the ability of the method to describe correctly the multipolar structure of aeroacoustic sources. The radiation of dipolar and quadrupolar extended sources is, thus, studied. Next, a typical problem in jet noise is considered with the propagation of acoustic waves in a sheared mean ow. The numerical solution compares favorably with ray tracing. Finally, a nonlinear formulation of Euler's equations is solved to limit the growth of instability waves excited by the acoustic source terms.},

The dominant source observed in the South Atlantic was seismic air gun signals, while shipping and biologic sources contributed more to the acoustic environment at the Equatorial Pacific location. Sound levels over the past 5–6 yr in the Equatorial Pacific have decreased. Decreases were also observed in the ambient sound floor in the South Atlantic Ocean.

abstract = {In January 2011, the state of the polar vortex in the midlatitudes changed significantly due to a minor sudden stratospheric warming event. As a result, a bidirectional duct for infrasound propagation developed in the middle atmosphere that persisted for 2 weeks. The ducts were due to two zonal wind jets, one between 30 and 50 km and the other around 70 km altitude. In this paper, using microbarom source modeling, a previously unidentified source region in the eastern Mediterranean is identified, besides the more well known microbarom source regions in the Atlantic Ocean. Infrasound data are then presented in which the above mentioned bidirectional duct is observed in microbarom signals recorded at the International Monitoring System station I48TN in Tunisia, from the Mediterranean region to the east and from the Atlantic Ocean to the west. While the frequency bands of the two sources overlap, the Mediterranean signal is coherent up to about 0.6 Hz. This observation is consistent with the microbarom source modeling; the discrepancy in the frequency band is related to differences in the ocean wave spectra for the two basins considered. This work demonstrates the sensitivity of infrasound to stratospheric dynamics and illustrates that the classic paradigm of a unidirectional stratospheric duct for infrasound propagation can be broken during a sudden stratospheric warming event.},

The signals can be classified into two very broad families, based on the nature of their spectra. A first group features prominently monochromatic signals, whose frequency can, however, fluctuate with time during a single sequence of emission (typically lasting a few to a few tens of minutes). Such signals are generally reminiscent of those detected in 2000 in the Ross Sea and are generated principally in the Indian Ocean 'iceberg parking lot', between longitudes 144 degrees E and 156 degrees E. A new family of signals features a much broader spectrum, superimposed on a number of preferential frequencies suggesting the background activation of a number of resonators; these signals occur both in the parking lot and in the Southern Pacific. Further variations in spectra are documented inside each family. On the basis of similar in situ observations on Ross Sea icebergs under project SOUTHBERG, the first family is generally interpreted as expressing a stick-and-slip process during collisions between large iceberg masses. The second family of signals are observed during exceptional episodes of the otherwise silent drift of the icebergs in the deep Pacific Basin, some of which correlate with their passage over the various fronts defining the oceanographic southern convergence zone. Finally, a most recent episode of activity, generally similar to the above first family, was detected on 2004 December 3-4, at the ocean entry of the Dibble Ice Tongue, 600 km west of the parking lot along the coast of Antarctica. It is interpreted as resulting from collisions between large drifting icebergs and fragments of the ice tongue calved off during its disintegration, as documented by satellite imagery.},

Therefore, reducing stratospheric forecast error may be one way to improve the skill of tropospheric weather forecasts. In this review, the basis for this idea is examined. A range of studies of different stratospheric extreme vortex events shows that they can be skilfully forecasted beyond 5 days and into the sub-seasonal range (0-30 days) in some cases. Separate studies show that typical errors in forecasting a stratospheric extreme vortex event can alter tropospheric forecast skill by 5-7{\%} in the extratropics on sub-seasonal time-scales. Thus understanding what limits stratospheric predictability is of significant interest to operational forecasting centres. Both limitations in forecasting tropospheric planetary waves and stratospheric model biases have been shown to be important in this context.},

abstract = {In our recent paper, the sensitivity of infrasound to the upper atmosphere is investigated using impulsive signals from the Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador. We reported on the coherent variability of thermospheric travel times, with periods equal to those of the tidal harmonics. Moreover, it was shown that the error in predicted thermospheric travel time is in accord with typical uncertainties in the upper atmospheric wind speed models. Given the observed response of the infrasound celerities to upper atmospheric tidal variability, it was suggested that infrasound observations may be used to reduce uncertainty in the knowledge of the atmospheric specifications in the upper atmosphere. In this paper, we discuss the estimation of upper atmospheric wind model updates from the infrasound data described in the aforementioned paper. The parameterization of the model space by empirical orthogonal functions is described; it is found that the wind model in the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere can be described by a four-parameter model. Due to the small dimensionality of the model space, a grid search method can be used to solve the inverse problem. A Bayesian method is used to assess the uncertainty in the inverse solution given the a priori uncertainty in the data and model spaces and the nonlinearity of the inverse problem at hand. We believe that this is the first study in which such methods are applied to real infrasound data, allowing for a rigorous analysis of this inverse problem. It is found that the complexity of the a posteriori model distribution increases for a larger dimensional model space and larger uncertainties in the data. A case study is presented in which the nonlinear propagation from source to receiver is simulated using an updated wind model and nonlinear ray theory. As nonlinear propagation effects further constrain the propagation path, this is a way to check the physical self-consistency of the travel time inversion approach. We obtain excellent agreement between the simulated and observed waveforms.},

We present elementary, exact solutions of linearized hydrodynamics equations, which describe the new type of waves in the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. The solutions provide an extension of surface gravity waves in an incompressible fluid half-space with a free boundary to waves in compressible, three-dimensionally inhomogeneous, rotating fluids.},

At thousands of kilometers from Tahiti, microbaroms are mainly produced by standing ocean waves near low-pressure systems in the south Pacific. Their monitoring over one year exhibits clear seasonal trends correlated with changes in the prevailing stratospheric wind direction. More locally, ocean waves propagating towards Tahiti also generate surf noise when impacting against the reefs. Analyzing the infrasonic recordings, the main source regions of surf signals are identified and their locations and seasonal variations are discussed.},

abstract = {A method to determine cutoff frequencies for linear acoustic waves propagating in nonisothermal media is introduced. The developed method is based on wave variable transformations that lead to Klein-Gordon equations, and the oscillation theorem is applied to obtain the turning point frequencies. Physical arguments are used to justify the choice of the largest turning point frequency as the cutoff frequency. The method is used to derive the cutoff frequencies in nonisothermal media modeled by exponential and power law temperature gradients, for which the cutoffs cannot be obtained based on known analytical solutions. An interesting result is that the acoustic cutoff frequencies calculated by the method are local quantities that vary in the media, and that their specific values at a given height determine the frequency that acoustic waves must have in order to be propagating at this height. To extend this physical interpretation of the acoustic cutoff frequency to nonisothermal media of arbitrary temperature gradients, a generalized version of the method applicable to these media is also presented.},

The algorithm has been used to model signals from a large bolide that burst above a dense seismic network in the US Pacific Northwest on 19 February, 2008. We compare synthetics that have been computed using a G2S-ECMWF atmospheric model to signals recorded at the seismic networks located along an azimuth of 210° from the source; the results show that the timing and the range extent of the direct, stratospherically ducted and thermospherically ducted acoustic branches are accurately predicted. However, estimates of absorption obtained from standard attenuation models (Sutherland-Bass) predict much greater absorption for thermospheric returns at frequencies greater than 0.1 Hz than is observed. We conclude that either the standard absorption model for the thermospheric is incorrect, or that thermospheric returns undergo non-linear propagation at very high altitude. In the former case, a better understanding of atmospheric absorption at high altitudes is required; in the latter, a fully nonlinear numerical method is needed to test our hypothesis that higher frequency arrivals from the thermosphere result from nonlinear propagation at thermospheric altitudes.},

@incollection{Philander2006,
abstract = {The second half of the twentieth century was a most remarkable period in the field of physical oceanography. Into the 1980s oceanographers were still relying on stars and sextants to gather information as vitally important as the position of a ship at sea. Asking for "a tall ship and a star to steer her by" was not merely a romantic wish, but a practical necessity. Today it is possible to pinpoint the location of a ship by means of the Global Positioning System (GPS) which depends on several satellites in space. Such a remarkable change presumably had a profound effect on the way oceanographers see themselves, and the way they relate to the oceans. Sextants are the instruments of explorers-individualists who brave the elements and venture into uncharted territory in search of new worlds. Did the launching of the Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, in 1957, cause oceanography to lose its romance? Are there any worlds still to be conquered? No, oceanography has not lost its romance, and, yes, there still are exciting discoveries to be made. I did not anticipate these answers when, during the 1990s, I tried to fathom why I was becoming more and more discontented with developments inmyfield, physical oceanography. Wasmydisquietude simply part of growing old, as several of my contemporaries, including Dennis Moore, Ed Sarachik, Jacques Merle, and Jay McCreary, suggested? Or are there objective reasons for being concerned about the activities of oceanographers today? There are ample reasons for nostalgia about the recent, post-Sputnik past. The launching of that satellite changed oceanography radically, but not adversely; it proved a bonanza for science in general, physical oceanography in particular. For a while scientists had easy access to resources for research, and enjoyed remarkable freedom to pursue science for the sake of science-science for the sake of understanding natural phenomena. The problems that oceanographers chose to investigate, related mostly to oceanic variability, yielded rich rewards. During the early 1990s it became evident that this exciting period was coming to an end. Three changes were clearly evident. (i) Oceanography, which used to be "bottom-up," with scientists identifying problems to be solved, then organizing and implementing programs to do so, had become "top-down" with managers and bureaucrats playing far more prominent roles. (ii) The field had lost some of its cohesion. For example, the perspectives of different groups on the same phenomenon, El Ni{\~{n}}o, became so different that the mere title of a paper on that topic now indicates whether the author is from Seattle, Los Angeles, or New York. (iii) Whereas the scientific and social interests of oceanographers used to be divorced-opposition to thewar inVietnam or apartheid in South Africa did not affect the choice of research topics-many scientists now want their science to influence policy. At first I was unable to articulate why I was uncomfortable with these developments, especially the last one. By chance I came across two authors who provide valuable insights. One is Derek de Solla Price1 who describes lucidly what happens when a "little science" grows into a "Big Science." (Although his is one of the most frequently cited books in the field of history and philosophy of science, surprisingly few scientists know of it.) The other author is the philosopher Isaiah Berlin2 who explains eloquently why the profound differences between the worlds of science and of human affairs can cause the two worlds to be in conflict. A scientist who predicts El Ni{\~{n}}o, for example, should expect other scientists to be skeptical of the results; the practice of "organized skepticism" is essential for progress in science. On the other hand, a scientist who tries to persuade government officials that the prediction calls for the implementation of certain policies, will have no success if he is skeptical of the forecast. We should at least be aware of such dilemmas when we try to bridge science and politics. We should also appreciate that an excessive reliance on science in our attempts to deal with the societal aspects of environmental problems can be counterproductive if not disastrous. This is clearly evident in our attempts to cope with failures of the Indian monsoons early in the twentieth century.3 The continually changing social and political environment strongly influences the activities of scientists. The period from 1957 to 1982, a most unusual one for physical oceanography, was initiated and terminated by the same global political factors. The exciting period started because of concern that the former Soviet Union could be scientifically more advanced than the countries of the West. It ended when the fall of communism prompted the sponsors of scientific research to start demanding useful results. The political change did not occur until the late 1980s but in oceanography a change was evident as early as 1982 when an entirely unexpected, severe El Ni{\~{n}}o impressed on oceanographers their obligation to alert the public of imminent disasters. Today oceanographers face a world very different from that of the 1960s. The competition for resources has become fierce, and the sponsors of research demand results that are of practical value. Maintaining a balance between the two complementary and equally important goals of science-science for the sake of understanding natural phenomena, and science for the sake of useful results-has become very difficult. Despite these differences, there are similarities between the situation today and that of the 1960s. Then, an interest in oceanic variability led to the melding of scientists with different backgrounds; observationalists, theoreticians, oceanographers, and meteorologists all interacted closely, thus creating a new community. This integration led to beneficial changes in the manner oceanographers conduct their affairs. Once again, today, groups with different backgrounds need to merge in order to make progress on challenging and important scientific questions. Foremost is the need to anticipate how the current, rapid rise in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide will affect the global climate. Changes in the oceanic circulation will be of central importance. Oceanographers have developed theories that explain that circulation, and the factors that can cause it to change, but a major problem is the lack of tests for the theories. The time scales of interest are so long, decades and more, that the measurements being made at present and in the near future will be of limited value. How do we respond to our sponsors who want answers soon? Stringent tests for the theories are available in the geological records of the very different climates the Earth experienced in its distant past. Oceanographers are therefore obliged to take an active interest in paleoclimates. The challenge is daunting because physical oceanography has a vocabulary and methods-a culture-very different from that of paleoclimatology. The situation today has similarities with that of the 1960s; communities with different interests and methods need to cooperate. Familiarity with what happened over the past few decades can be a valuable guide. This article tells the story of those decades from the perspective of an unexceptional participant blessed with exceptionally good fortune.

abstract = {The dynamics of the large-scale circulation pattern of the stratosphere in mid-winter is examined. A set of energy equations is derived which is applicable to the stratosphere as an open system. The terms of these equations, interpreted as energy conversions and fluxes, are evaluated using data from January 1958. The computed energy conversions were similar in sign to those found in the troposphere, and varied only in magnitude during the month, reaching maximum values prior to and during the stratosphere warming. The energy flux terms indicate a considerable amount of energy was transferred into the stratosphere through a correlation of the vertical velocity and geopotential, at the expense of energy of the troposphere. The possibility of a stratosphere-troposphere coupling is investigated further through harmonic analyses of the height field at levels from 1000 mb to 10 mb at {\{}50N.{\}} A vertical consistency of the long waves is revealed, throughout the depth studied, and evidence is found for the existence of periodic amplifications of wave numbers one and two which propagate upwards at the rate of about 6 km per day. From observational evidence a model is deduced to explain many of the observed features of the stratosphere circulation.},

abstract = {Horizontal resolution of general circulation models (GCMs) has significantly increased during the last decade, however these changes were not accompanied by similar changes in vertical resolution. In our study, the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5) is used to study the sensitivity of climate to vertical resolution and nonorographic gravity wave drag. Nonorographic gravity wave drag is typically omitted from low-top GCMs, however as we show, its influence on climate can be seen all the way to the surface. We show that an increase in vertical resolution from 1200 to 500 m in the free troposphere and lower stratosphere in CAM5 improves the representation of near-tropopause temperatures, lower stratospheric temperatures, and surface wind stresses. In combination with nonorographic gravity waves, CAM5 with increased vertical resolution produces a realistic Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), has an improved seasonal cycle of temperature in the extratropics, and represents better the coupling between the stratosphere and the troposphere.},

@article{McLandress2005,
abstract = {Abstract A comparison is undertaken of the response of a general circulation model (GCM) to the nonorographic gravity wave drag parameterizations of Hines, Warner and McIntyre, and Alexander and Dunkerton. The analysis is restricted to a comparison of each parameterization?s nonlinear dissipation mechanism since, in principle, this is the only component that differs between the schemes. This is achieved by developing a new, more general parameterization that can represent each of these dissipation mechanisms, while keeping all other aspects of the problem identical. The GCM simulations reveal differences in the climatological response to the three dissipation mechanisms. These differences are documented for both tropopause and surface launch elevations of the parameterized waves. The simulations also reveal systematic differences in the height at which momentum is deposited. This behavior is investigated further in a set of experiments designed to reduce these systematic differences, while leaving the details of the dissipation mechanisms unaltered. These sensitivity experiments demonstrate that it is possible to obtain nearly identical responses from all three mechanisms, which indicates that the GCM response is largely insensitive to the precise details of the dissipation mechanisms. This finding is supported by an additional experiment in which the nonlinear dissipation mechanisms are turned off and critical-level filtering is left to act as the only source of dissipation. In this experiment, critical-level filtering effectively replaces the nonlinear dissipation mechanism, producing a nearly identical response. The results of this study suggest that climate modeling efforts would potentially benefit more from the refinement of other aspects of the parameterization problem, such as the properties of the launch spectrum, than they have benefited from the refinement of dissipation mechanisms.},

Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) that accounts for Zeeman line

March 2011 are shown to be in good agreement with coincident temperature
measurements from the Sounding of the Atmosphere Using Broadband
Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument that were used to simulate UAS
brightness temperatures. Four NAVGEM experiments were performed during
July 2010 that assimilated (i) no mesospheric observations, (ii) UAS
data only, (iii) SABER and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) mesospheric
temperatures only, and (iv) SABER, MLS, and UAS data. Zonal mean
temperatures and observation - forecast differences for the UAS-only and
SABER+MLS experiments are similar throughout most of the mesosphere, and
show large improvements over the experiment assimilating no mesospheric
observations, proving that assimilation of UAS radiances can provide a
reliable large-scale constraint throughout the mesosphere for
operational, high-altitude analysis. This is confirmed by comparison of
solar migrating tides and the quasi-two-day wave in the mesospheric
analyses. The UAS-only experiment produces realistic tidal and two-day
wave amplitudes in the summer mesosphere in agreement with the
experiments assimilating MLS and SABER observations, whereas the

These stations recorded infrasound signals from the event at distances from 6000 to 10000 km across a sector spanning 55° that encompassed the North Pole. This dense, extensive network permitted a detailed study of long-range infrasound propagation and source characteristics. We observe long wavetrains at all stations (ranging to over 100 min) but clear variations in the character of the wavetrains across the network. Ray-tracing through a spatially and temporally varying atmospheric model indicates the source excited resonance in the thermospheric duct to all stations. Resonance was also excited in a persistent stratospheric duct between the source and stations in Alaska and along the west coast of the United States due to favorable winds at those azimuths, leading to higher group velocities and frequency content at these stations than those to the east. An attenuation formula derived from parabolic equation simulations is used to estimate infrasound transmission losses at all stations, using simplified models of the effective sound speed along each source-receiver path. Observed variations in signal energies from higher than expected at stations in the thermospheric duct in the eastern United States, to lower than expected in Alaska, at azimuths nearly orthogonal to the asteroid's Mach cone, lead us to conclude that (1) the source was dominantly isotropic and (2) the model overestimates attenuation in the thermospheric duct.},

The Seismology Division of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) operates since 1999 an experimental infrasound array of 16 micro-barometers. Here we show the rare detection and identication of an exploding meteor above Northern Germany on November 8th, 1999 with data from the Deelen Infrasound Array (DIA). At the same time, sound was radiated from the Atlantic Ocean, South of Iceland, due to the atmospheric coupling of standing ocean waves, called microbaroms. Occurring with only 0.04 Hz di erence in dominant frequency, DIA proved to be able to discriminate between the physically di erent sources of infrasound through its unique lay-out and instruments. The explosive power of the meteor being 1.5 kT TNT is in the range of nuclear explosions and therefore relevant to the CTBT.},

abstract = {An important aspect of the physical sciences is to make inferences about physical parameters from data. In general, the laws of physics provide the means for computing the data values given a model. This is called the “forward problem”, see ﬁgure 1. In the inverse problem, the aim is to reconstruct the model from a set of measurements. In the ideal case, an exact theory exists that prescribes how the data should be transformed in order to reproduce the model. For some selected examples such a theory exists assuming that the required inﬁnite and noise-free data sets would be available. A quantum mechanical potential in one spatial dimension can be reconstructed when the reﬂection coeﬃcient is known for all energies [Marchenko, 1955; Burridge, 1980]. This technique can be generalized for the reconstruction of a quantum mechanical potential in three dimensions [Newton, 1989], but in that case a redundant data set is required for reasons that are not well understood. The mass-density in a one-dimensional string can be constructed from the measurements of all eigenfrequencies of that string [Borg, 1946], but due to the symmetry of this problem only the even part of the mass-density can be determined.

abstract = {The simulation of major midwinter stratospheric sudden warmings (SSWs) in six stratosphere-resolving general circulation models (GCMs) is examined. The GCMs are compared to a new climatology of SSWs, based on the dynamical characteristics of the events. First, the number, type, and temporal distribution of SSW events are evaluated. Most of the models show a lower frequency of SSW events than the climatology, which has a mean frequency of 6.0 SSWs per decade. Statistical tests show that three of the six models produce significantly fewer SSWs than the climatology, between 1.0 and 2.6 SSWs per decade. Second, four process-based diagnostics are calculated for all of the SSW events in each model. It is found that SSWs in the GCMs compare favorably with dynamical benchmarks for SSW established in the first part of the study. These results indicate that GCMs are capable of quite accurately simulating the dynamics required to produce SSWs, but with lower frequency than the climatology. Further dynamical diagnostics hint that, in at least one case, this is due to a lack of meridional heat flux in the lower stratosphere. Even though the SSWs simulated by most GCMs are dynamically realistic when compared to the NCEPNCAR reanalysis, the reasons for the relative paucity of SSWs in GCMs remains an important and open question.},

abstract = {In comparison to the lower atmosphere where comprehensive global atmospheric specifications are commonplace, the ability to perform routine global measurements of the properties of the atmosphere above the stratopause continues to be an active area of scientific research. In this paper, we revisit the use of infrasound as a remote sensing technique for horizontal winds in the upper atmosphere. To use infrasound to monitor the winds in the upper atmosphere, a sufficiently strong and persistent infrasound source is required. In addition, because of the highly attenuating nature of the thermosphere, the signals used must have low enough frequency content to survive. In this paper, impulsive signals from the Tungurahua volcano in Ecuador are used. This volcano has gone through periods of intense activity during which impulsive signals of dominant periods between 3 and 5 s are emitted. Depending on the atmospheric conditions, stratospheric, mesospheric, and thermospheric arrivals are observed. It is found that the traveltimes of the thermospheric arrivals exhibit a coherent variability with periods equal to those of the tidal harmonics. As such, these observations suggest a means of passive atmospheric remote sensing that can be utilized in conjunction with other techniques to routinely measure the state of the upper atmosphere.},

abstract = {Over the decade 1996–2006, acoustic sources located off central California (1996–1999) and north of Kauai (1997–1999, 2002–2006) transmitted to receivers distributed throughout the northeast and north central Pacific. The acoustic travel times are inherently spatially integrating, which suppresses mesoscale variability and provides a precise measure of ray-averaged temperature. Daily average travel times at 4-day intervals provide excellent temporal resolution of the large-scale thermal field. The interannual, seasonal, and shorter-period variability is large, with substantial changes sometimes occurring in only a few weeks. Linear trends estimated over the decade are small compared to the interannual variability and inconsistent from path to path, with some acoustic paths warming slightly and others cooling slightly. The measured travel times are compared with travel times derived from four independent estimates of the North Pacific: (1) climatology, as represented by the World Ocean Atlas 2005 (WOA05); (2) objective analysis of the upper-ocean temperature field derived from satellite altimetry and in situ profiles; (3) an analysis provided by the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean project, as implemented at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL-ECCO); and (4) simulation results from a high-resolution configuration of the Parallel Ocean Program (POP) model. The acoustic data show that WOA05 is a better estimate of the time mean hydrography than either the JPL-ECCO or the POP estimates, both of which proved incapable of reproducing the observed acoustic arrival patterns. The comparisons of time series provide a stringent test of the large-scale temperature variability in the models. The differences are sometimes substantial, indicating that acoustic thermometry data can provide significant additional constraints for numerical ocean models.},

@article{Wapenaar2010a,
abstract = {In the 1990s, the method of time-reversed acoustics was developed. This method exploits the fact that the acoustic wave equation for a lossless medium is invariant for time reversal. When ultrasonic responses recorded by piezoelectric transducers are reversed in time and fed simultaneously as source signals to the transducers, they focus at the position of the original source, even when the medium is very complex. In seismic interferometry the time-reversed responses are not physically sent into the earth, but they are convolved with other measured responses. The effect is essentially the same: The time-reversed signals focus and create a virtual source which radiates waves into the medium that are subsequently recorded by receivers. A mathematical derivation, based on reciprocity theory, formalizes this principle: The crosscorrelation of responses at two receivers, integrated over differ-ent sources, gives the Green's function emitted by a virtual source at the position of one of the receivers and observed by the other receiver. This Green's function representation for seismic interferometry is based on the assumption that the medium is lossless and nonmoving. Recent developments, circumventing these assumptions, include interferometric representations for attenuating and/or moving media, as well as unified representations for waves and diffusion phenomena, bending waves, quantum mechanical scattering, potential fields, elastodynamic, electromagnetic, poroelastic, and electroseismic waves. Significant improvements in the quality of the retrieved Green's functions have been obtained with interferometry by deconvolution. A trace-by-trace deconvolution process compensates for complex source functions and the attenuation of the medium. Interferometry by multidimensional deconvolution also compensates for the effects of one-sided and/or irregular illumination.},

SATellite OBservation (SATOB) atmospheric-motion winds, radiosondes, aircraft, drifting buoys and Australian pseudo observations (PAOBs). The impact is assessed in both summer and winter 1999, over a total period of six weeks, in terms of the average objective quality of the deterministic forecast of tropospheric wind and geopotential height at medium (5-7 day) and short (1-3 day) ranges. It is shown that the choice of verification method matters in data-poor areas such as the tropics and the southern hemisphere. Some interesting conclusions can be drawn about the ECMWF 4D-Var system. Each observing system tested has a notable positive impact on the medium-range forecast performance. This is not always true at shorter ranges. The TOVS radiances have a large impact on all areas and ranges. Drifting buoys and PAOBs both have some impact in the southern hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere, the relative impact of TOVS, aircraft and radiosondes depends on the area considered. For Europe, the statistical significance of the results is limited, but the most important observing system among those tested appears to be the radiosondes.},

Time reversal focuses energy that passes through the overburden into useful primary energy for the VS. In contrast to physical acoustics, our time reversal is done on a computer, utilizing conventional acquisition with surface shots and downhole geophones.With this approach, we can image below extremely complex (realistic) overburden {\'{o}} in fact, the more complex the better. We recast the data to those with sources where we actually know and can control the waveform that has a downward-radiation pattern that may also be controlled, and is reproducible for 4D even if the near-surface changes or the shooting geometry is altered slightly.To illustrate the method, we apply the VS technique to a synthetic, elastic example with extreme heterogeneity, where conventional approaches fail to image the data. A 4D field-data example shows that the VS method (VSM) enables sensitive reservoir monitoring below a complex, time-variant near surface that is not achievable with surface 4D seismic or conventional 4D vertical seismic profiling (VSP).},

abstract = {Abstract Ahyi is a fully submerged arc volcano in the Northern Mariana Islands, northwestern Pacific Ocean. In April and May 2014, the volcano erupted over a period of 15 days. Results from direction‐of‐arrival calculations show that underwater sound phases associated with the episode were recorded as far as Wake Island, where a hydrophone triplet array is operated as part of the International Monitoring System. After a 3.5 hours long sequence of hydroacoustic precursory events, explosive volcanic activity occurred in two distinct, several‐days‐long bursts, accompanied by a notable decrease in low‐frequency arrivals that may indicate a shift in signal source parameters. Acoustic resolution of the hydrophone data supersedes broadband networks by almost one order of magnitude, successfully identifying seismic events at Ahyi as low as 2.5 mb. Total radiated acoustic energy of the eruption is estimated at 9.7 1013 J, which suggests that submarine volcanic activity contributed significantly to the ocean soundscape.},

abstract = {The Earth's atmosphere is often portrayed as a thin and finite blanket covering our planet, separate from the emptiness of outer space. In reality, the transition is gradual and a tiny fraction of the atmophere gases is still present at the altitude of low orbiting satellites. The very high velocities of these satellites ensure that their orbital motion can still be considerably affected by air density and wind. This influence can be measured using accelerometers and satellite tracking techniques. The opening chapters of this thesis provide an excellent introduction to the various disciplines that are involved in the interpretation of these observations: orbital mechanics, satellite aerodynamics and upper atmospheric physics. A subsequent chapter, at the heart of this work, covers advances in the algorithms used for processing satellite accelerometry and Two-Line Element (TLE) orbit data. The closing chapters provide an elaborate analysis of the resulting density and wind products, which are generating many opportunities for further research, to improve the modelling and understanding of the thermosphere system and its interactions with the lower atmosphere, the ionosphere-magnetosphere system and the Sun.},

abstract = {The Green's function of waves that propagate between two receivers can be found by cross-correlating multiply scattered waves recorded at these receivers. This technique obviates the need for a source at one of these locations, and is therefore called "passive imaging." This principle has been explained by assuming that the normal modes of the system are uncorrelated and that all carry the same amount of energy (equipartitioning). Here I present an alternative derivation of passive imaging of the ballistic wave that is not based on normal modes. The derivation is valid for scalar waves in three dimensions, and for elastic surface waves. Passive imaging of the ballistic wave is based on the destructive interference of waves radiated from scatterers away from the receiver line, and the constructive interference of waves radiated from secondary sources near the receiver line. The derivation presented here shows that the global requirement of the equipartitioning of normal modes can be relaxed to the local requirement that the scattered waves propagate on average isotropically near the receivers.},

abstract = {We present a new spatial filter designed to separate short-length-scale bathymetric features from regional bathymetry. The directional median (DiM) filter divides a given filter circle into N “bow tie” sectors, allocates data points inside the filter circle to each sector based on their relative position within the circle, estimates a median for each sector, and returns the lowest of these N medians. This approach prevents DiM filtering from choosing the biased medians near the features on a sloping regional trend, which is a serious artifact of standard median filtering. As the bathymetry comprises diverse length-scale features, the separated results vary with the choice of filter width. Such variations are spatially distributed. Using a finite range of filter widths, we evaluate the spatial distribution of variations in the DiM-based separation by estimating their median absolute deviation (MAD) at each data point. The distribution of MAD values is indicative of uncertainties inherent in the separation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiM filtering with both synthetic and actual bathymetric data.},

Surprising consistency is found among observations and all model simulations, despite variation of the altitudes of model upper boundaries from 32 to 76 km in the IPCC models and at 135 km for WACCM. These results are consistent with previous suggestions that placing a model's upper boundary at low altitude leads to partly compensating errors—such as reducing the forcing of the tides by ozone heating, but also introducing spurious waves at the u...},

abstract = {The propagation of acoustic waves in the ocean strongly depends on the temperature. Low- frequency acoustic waves can penetrate the ocean down to depths where few in situ measure- ments are available. It is therefore attractive to obtain a measure of the deep ocean temperature from acousticwaves. The latter is especially true if the ambient acoustic noise field can be used instead of deterministic transient signals. In this study the acoustic velocity, and hence the temperature, is derived in an interferometric approach from hydrophone array recordings. The arrays were separated by over 125 km, near Ascension Island in the Atlantic Ocean, at a depth of 850 m. Furthermore, the dispersive characteristics of the deep ocean sound channel are resolved based on the retrieved lag times for different modes. In addition, it is shown how the resolution of the interferometric approach can be increased by cross correlating array beams rather than recordings from single-sensor pairs. The observed acoustic lag times between the arrays correspondswell to modelled values, based on full-wave modelling through best-known oceanic models.},

Continuous infrasound monitoring over 5 years show that microbaroms are globally observed at several middle- and high-latitude infrasound stations that are part of the International Monitoring System (IMS). The arrival azimuths and amplitude of the signals exhibit clear seasonal trends driven primarily by the seasonal reversal of the zonal stratospheric wind. A scaling relation between the signal amplitude and the strength of the upper wind suggests that most of the microbarom energy propagates in the ground to stratosphere waveguide. We show that continuous microbarom measurements can help to evaluate global infrasound detection capabilities, providing new insights on quantitative relationships between infrasonic observables and atmospheric specifications.},

He outlined several areas of research and application to potentially benefit from what is now com- monly called whole atmosphere modeling. The purpose of this article is to introduce this new field to a broader geo- physical community and document its progress over the last decade. Vertically extended models are commonly built from existing weather and climate GCM codes incorporating a number of approximations, which may no longer be valid. Promising directions offurther model development, potential applications, and challenges are outlined. One application is space weather or day‐to‐day and seasonal variability in the ionosphere and thermosphere driven by meteorological processes from below. Various modes of connection between the lower and upper atmosphere had been known before, but new and sometimes unexpected observational evidence has emerged over the last decade. Persistent “nonmigrating” wavy structures in plasma and neutral densities and a dramatic response ofthe equatorial ionosphere to sudden warmings in the polar winter stratosphere are just two examples. Because large‐scale meteorological processes are predictable several days in advance, whole atmosphere weather predic- tion models open an opportunity for developing a real fore- cast capability for space weather.},

Under this assumption, it is shown how simple consistency diagnostics can be obtained for the covariances of observation, background and estimation errors in observation space. Those diagnostics are shown to be nearly cost-free since they only combine quantities available after the analysis, i.e. observed values and their background and analysis counterparts in observation space. A first application of such diagnostics is presented on analyses provided by the French 4D-Var assimilation. A procedure to refine background and observation-error variances is also proposed and tested in a simple toy analysis problem. The possibility to diagnose cross-correlations between observation errors is also investigated in this same simple framework. A spectral interpretation of the diagnosed covariances is finally presented, which allows us to highlight the role of the scale separation between background and observation errors.

The measured waveforms differ consistently with the theories in that the observed wave has an initial positive (or condensation) pulse followed by a negative (or rarefaction) pulse; whereas theories predicted only a negative pulse. The electrical heating of the air by positive streamer systems during the discharge is computed in this theoretical paper. This rapid (supersonic) electrical heating, although small (∼10−6 T0), produces a positive pressure perturbation (∼10−1 Pa), which when added to the negative electrostatic pressure perturbation generates an acoustic wave consistent with measured signals. A positive pulse always precedes the negative pulse in this model, and the positive pulse is always smaller in amplitude than the negative. The durations of the positive and negative pulses are similar. When more realistic models are employed, the observed signal can be related through theory to physical parameters in the thundercloud.},

Wilks' excellent book provides a thorough base in applied statistical methods for atmospheric sciences."–BAMS (Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society) Fundamentally, statistics is concerned with managing data and making inferences and forecasts in the face of uncertainty. It should not be surprising, therefore, that statistical methods have a key role to play in the atmospheric sciences. It is the uncertainty in atmospheric behavior that continues to move research forward and drive innovations in atmospheric modeling and prediction. This revised and expanded text explains the latest statistical methods that are being used to describe, analyze, test and forecast atmospheric data. It features numerous worked examples, illustrations, equations, and exercises with separate solutions. Statistical Methods in the Atmospheric Sciences, Second Edition will help advanced students and professionals understand and communicate what their data sets have to say, and make sense of the scientific literature in meteorology, climatology, and related disciplines. Accessible presentation and explanation of techniques for atmospheric data summarization, analysis, testing and forecasting Many worked examples End-of-chapter exercises, with answers provided.},

abstract = {Infrasound is low-frequency inaudible sound ({\textless} 20Hz), used as a waveform verification technique for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). In this thesis, it is shown that infrasound can provide useful additional upper atmospheric observations in a region where data coverage is sparse; beyond the middle stratosphere direct information of wind is missing in current numerical weather prediction models. Passive ambient infrasound signals can act as an atmospheric probe. Observed and simulated infrasound wavefront parameters are compared, i.e., back azimuth, apparent velocity, or travel time. Wavefront parameters are extracted from the continuous waveform recordings using signal detectors and array processing techniques and simulated by ray theory using various atmospheric conditions. The theoretical basis of this method relies on the assertion that sound propagates through a particular atmospheric state. The state that is closest to reality will then lead to simulated values that are closest to the observed values. It is demonstrated that infrasound has the potential to contribute to operational weather prediction applications by validation of atmospheric analysis and forecast products, in particular in regions above 30 km altitude. In addition, knowledge of the dynamical stratosphere is utilized for infrasound monitoring, in order to benefit CTBT verification efforts.},

@article{Frazier2014,
abstract = {Acoustic data recorded at 1000 samples per second by two sensor arrays located at ranges of 1-113 km from three tornadoes that occurred on 24 May 2011 in Oklahoma are analyzed. Accurate bearings to the tornadoes have been obtained using beamforming methods applied to the data at infrasonic frequencies. Beamforming was not viable at audio frequencies, but the data demonstrate the ability to detect significant changes in the shape of the estimated power spectral density in the band encompassing 10Hz to approximately 100Hz at distances of practical value from the sensors. This suggests that arrays of more closely spaced sensors might provide better bearing accuracy at practically useful distances from a tornado. Additionally, a mathematical model, based on established relationships of aeroacoustic turbulence, is demonstrated to provide good agreement to the estimated power spectra produced by the tornadoes at different times and distances from the sensors. The results of this analysis indicate that, qualitatively, an inverse relationship appears to exist between the frequency of an observed peak of the power spectral density and the reported tornado intensity.

abstract = {A wave equation, derived using the acoustic medium assumption for P-waves in transversely isotropic (TI) media with a vertical symmetry axis (VTI media), yields a good kinematic approximation to the familiar elastic wave equation for VTI media. The wavefield solutions obtained using this VTI acoustic wave equation are free of shear waves, which significantly reduces the computation time compared to the elastic wavefield solutions for exploding‐reflector type applications. From this VTI acoustic wave equation, the eikonal and transport equations that describe the ray theoretical aspects of wave propagation in a TI medium are derived. These equations, based on the acoustic assumption (shear wave velocity = 0), are much simpler than their elastic counterparts, yet they yield an accurate description of traveltimes and geometrical amplitudes. Numerical examples prove the usefulness of this acoustic equation in simulating the kinematic aspects of wave propagation in complex TI models.},

abstract = {A large explosion occurred at the Buncefield Oil Depot, United Kingdom, on the 2005 December 11, as the result of a spillage of 300 tonnes of petrol. The explosion generated large amplitude infrasonic signals that were recorded at ranges of up to 1400 km. We present an analysis of data from across Central Europe using seven infrasound arrays, four of which recorded a total of 20 infrasonic arrivals, and 49 seismometers, which recorded 89 air-to-ground coupled arrivals. Exceptionally high amplitude stratospheric winds occurred at the time of the explosion, propagating east–southeast with speeds of up to 130 m s−1, generating a highly efficient duct for infrasound propagation. The Buncefield explosion can therefore be considered as a benchmark for studying the influence of different propagation algorithms and atmospheric models on phase identification, source location and yield estimation. Significant improvements are made in phase identification using accurate atmospheric parametrizations and 3-D modelling, where we identify 18 of the 20 observed phases, compared to seasonal atmospheric models and 1-D ray tracing which only identify seven of the phases. Additionally, various location scenarios are considered, including cross-bearings and least-squares traveltime and backazimuth inversion, all of which estimate locations within 35 km of ground truth. A novel single array location method using multiple phases works comparably well. Yield estimates made using the stratospheric arrival amplitudes exhibit one order of magnitude variability across the network, with a mean estimate of 51 tonnes high explosive equivalent. Detailed studies, such as this, are important for developing a successful monitoring regime for atmospheric or surface events, and for assessing the capability of the infrasound monitoring component of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty verification system.},

abstract = {Most of Earths volcanoes are under water. As a result of their relative inaccessibility, little is known of the structure and evolution of submarine volcanoes. Advances in navigation and sonar imaging techniques have made it possible to map submarine volcanoes in detail, and repeat surveys allow the identification of regions where the depth of the sea floor is actively changing. Here we report the results of a bathymetric survey of Monowai submarine volcano in the TongaKermadec Arc, which we mapped twice within 14 days. We found marked differences in bathymetry between the two surveys, including an increase in seafloor depth up to 18.8 m and a decrease in depth up to 71.9 m. We attribute the depth increase to collapse of the volcano summit region and the decrease to growth of new lava cones and debris flows. Hydroacoustic T-wave data reveal a 5-day-long swarm of seismic events with unusually high amplitude between the surveys, which directly link the depth changes to explosive activity at the volcano. The collapse and growth rates implied by our data are extremely high, compared with measured long-term growth rates of the volcano, demonstrating the pulsating nature of submarine volcanism and highlighting the dynamic nature of the sea floor.},

The global infrasound network, which consists of the International Monitoring Network (IMS) for nuclear test ban verification completed by an increasing number of regional cluster arrays deployed around the globe, has evidenced an unprecedented potential for detecting, locating and characterizing various natural and man-made sources. In recent years, infrasound has evolved into a broad interdisciplinary field encompassing academic disciplines of geophysics and innovative technical and scientific developments. The advances in innovative ground-based instruments, including infrasound inversions for continuous observations of the stratosphere and mesosphere, provide useful insights into the geophysical source phenomenology and atmospheric processes involved. Systematic investigations into low-frequency infrasound signals and the development of complementary observational platforms point out new insights into the dynamics of the middle atmosphere which play a significant role in both tropospheric weather and climate. This monitoring system also provides continuous relevant information about natural hazards with high societal benefits, like on-going volcanic eruptions, surface earthquakes, meteorites or severe weather. With this new edition, researchers and students benefit from a comprehensive content of both fundamental and applied inter-disciplinary topics.},

For very low frequency the ocean acts as a shallow-water waveguide and lateral variability in bathymetry can lead to out-of-plane effects. In this paper, data from the International Monitoring System of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) is used to present two cases where robustly localized seismic events in locations clearly within the two-dimensional (2-D) shadow of a continent or large island generate T-phase signals that are received on a hydro-acoustic station. A fully three- dimensional parabolic equation model is used to demonstrate that lateral variability of the bathymetry can lead to diffraction, explaining both observations. The implications of this are that the CTBTO network has greater coverage than predicted by 2-D models and that inclusion of diffraction in future processing can improve the automatic global associati...},

abstract = {Thunder, the sound wave through the air associated with lightning, transfers sufficient energy to the ground to trigger seismometers set to record regional earthquakes. The acoustic signature recorded on seismometers, in the form of ground velocity as a function of time, contains the same type features as pressure variations recorded with microphones in air. At a seismic station in Kislovodsk, USSR, a nearly direct lightning strike caused electronic failure of borehole instruments while leaving a brief impulsive acoustic signature on the surface instruments. The peak frequency of 25–55 Hz is consistent with previously published values for cloud-to-ground lightning strikes, but spectra from this station are contaminated by very strong wind noise in this band. A thunderstorm near a similar station in Karasu triggered more than a dozen records of individual lightning strikes during a 2-hour period. The spectra for these events are fairly broadband, with peaks at low frequencies, varying from 6 to 13 Hz. The spectra were all computed by multitaper analysis, which deals appropriately with the nonstationary thunder signal. These independent measurements of low-frequency peaks corroborate the occasional occurrences in traditional microphone records, but a theory concerning the physical mechanism to account for them is still in question. Examined separately, the individual claps in each record have similar frequency distributions, discounting a need for multiple mechanisms to explain different phases of the thunder sequence. Particle motion, determined from polarization analysis of the three-component records, is predominantly vertical downward, with smaller horizontal components indicative of the direction to the lightning bolt. In three of the records the azimuth to the lightning bolt changes with time, confirming a significant horizontal component to the lightning channel itself.},

These are smaller storms, often travel much faster, and have steeper atmospheric pressure gradients that produce very strong winds. All storm systems generate various types of microseisms, which have been studied extensively. A special case of fast-developing, small, extratropical storms in which the central pressure intensifies rapidly, dropping by more than 1 mbar/hour for 24 hours, is called a ” weather bomb” (1).

abstract = {Seismic and infrasound multistation ambient-noise interferometry has been widely used to infer ground and atmospheric properties, and single-station and autocorrelation seismic interferometry has also shown potential for characterizing Earth structure at multiple scales. We extend autocorrelation seismic interferometry to ambient atmospheric infrasound recordings that contain persistent local noise from waterfalls and rivers. Across a range of geographic settings, we retrieve relative sound-speed changes that exhibit clear diurnal oscillations consistent with temperature and wind variations. We estimate ambient air temperatures from variations in relative sound speeds. The frequency band from 1 to 2 Hz appears most suitable to retrieve weather parameters as nearby waterfalls and rivers may act as continuous and vigorous sources of infrasound that help achieve convergence of coherent phases in the autocorrelation codas. This frequency band is also appropriate for local sound-speed variations because it has infrasound with wavelengths of ∼170–340 m, corresponding to a typical atmospheric boundary layer height. After applying array analysis to autocorrelation functions derived from a three-element infrasound array, we find that autocorrelation codas are composed of waves reflected off nearby topographic features, such as caldera walls. Lastly, we demonstrate that autocorrelation infrasound interferometry offers the potential to study the atmosphere over at least several months and with a fine time resolution.},

The impact of these schemes on ensemble data assimilation and in seasonal forecasting is also considered. In all cases, the re-sults are positive. Validation of the form of these stochastic parametrizations can be found by coarse-grain budgets of high resolution (e.g. cloud-resolving) models; some results are shown. Stochastic parametriza-tion has been pioneered at ECMWF over the last decade, and now most operational centres use stochastic parametrization in their operational ensemble prediction systems -these are briefly discussed.

(in press) The long-term warming of the ocean is a critical indicator of both the past and present state of the climate system. It also provides insights about the changes to come, owing to the persistence of both decadal variations and secular trends, which the ocean records extremely well (Hansen et al., 2011; IPCC, 2013; Rhein et al., 2013; Trenberth et al., 2016; Abram et al., 2019). It is well established that the emission of greenhouse gasses by human activities is mainly responsible for global warming since the industrial revolution (IPCC, 2013; Abram et al., 2019). The increased concentration of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has interfered with natural energy flows. Currently there is an energy imbalance in the Earth's climate system of almost 1 W m −2 (Trenberth et al., 2014; von Schuckmann et al., 2016, 2020a; Wijffels et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2018; Cheng et al., 2019a; von Schuckmann et al., 2020a). Over 90{\%} of this excess heat is absorbed by the oceans, leading to an increase of ocean heat content (OHC) and sea level rise, mainly through thermal expansion and melting of ice over land. These processes provide a useful means to quantify climate change. The first global OHC time series by Levitus et al. (2000) identified a robust long-term 0−3000 m ocean warming from 1948−98. Since then, many other analyses of global and regional OHC data have been performed. Here, we provide the first analysis of recent ocean heating, incorporating 2020 measurements through 2020 into our analysis.},

abstract = {Abstract Energy generation, transfer and conversion processes in the stratosphere and troposphere are investigated for the January 1963 sudden stratospheric warming using spectral forms of the energy equations. Vertical velocities, potential energy generation rates and the meridional circulation are obtained from the vorticity equation and the thermodynamic energy equation. The overall energy budgets agree well with previous estimates. Zonal available potential energy generation is positive in the troposphere and middle stratosphere, while eddy generation is negative at all levels. The stratospheric meridional circulation consists of two indirect cells with subsidence at mid-latitudes. In the domain of wave number, significant differences in the behavior of individual long waves are evident. The spectacular growth and subsequent decline of wave number two in the stratosphere were associated with strong baroclinic energy conversions and a flux of geopotential which was upward at all levels, suggesting a link with the topography of the hemisphere. Barotropic nonlinear kinetic energy transfer between eddy components is also shown to be significant in the energy budgets in both troposphere and stratosphere.},

abstract = {Winter stratospheric warming observations and associated theories are reviewed. Historically, major warmings occur on the average everyother year and may thus be considered an important climatological componentof the winter stratosphere. The warming results from eddy heat transport from equatorial latitudes into the polar regions. The eddies chiefly responsible for the transport are the planetary scale waves which may attain amplitudes twice their monthly average values in the lower stratosphere prior to the warming. In the troposphere this amplitude increase is associated with the development of blocking patterns. The warming is shown to have a strong nonzonal component in the upper stratosphere, a feature not fully recognized by modelers. The critical level theory of the sudden stratospheric warming provides a simple dynamic explanation of the event. Yet mechanistic numerical models which have reproduced many features of the warming exhibit results which tend to indicate that the interaction of planetary waves and the mean flow occurs through a variety of mechanisms including transience and damping. The close connection between blocking in the troposphere and the development of the sudden warming is likely to be a result of resonance of free planetary waves in a stratospheric wind cavity.},

abstract = {Continuous long-term sound sources are recorded at hydroacoustic station H03S, a three-element hydrophone array south of Robinson Crusoe Island between 2014 April 23 and 2017 August 20. The origin of the signal between 3 and 20 Hz is investigated by using cross-correlation, array processing using plane wave beamforming and spectral analysis. One-bit normalization is successfully applied as a cross-correlation pre-processing step in order to suppress undesired earthquake events in the data. Traveltimes retrieved from averaged cross-correlations do not yield a coherent array direction of arrival. Averaged envelopes of the cross-correlations, however, indicate a coherent signal approaching H03S from a south–southwest direction. Beamforming indicates two dominant backazimuth directions: 172°–224° (Antarctica) and 242° (Monowai Volcanic Seamount). This continuous source field creates possibilities to investigate the applicability of acoustic thermometry at hydrophones H03 S1–S2. Cross-correlation and array processing indicate significant directional variation in local propagation, most likely related to the steep slope in the bathymetry near H03S. In addition, it is demonstrated that the ambient noise field is not sufficiently equipartitioned. It is shown that this causes a large error in the estimated temperature, primarily due to the short receiver spacing. These large errors have not been addressed in previous studies on deep-ocean acoustic thermometry. Hence, it is shown that acoustic thermometry does not perform well on small arrays such as H03S. The power spectral density yields a strong broadband signal in January–March, most likely related to iceberg noise. A narrow banded signal around 17 Hz between April and September corresponds to whale calls. The best-beam sound pressure levels towards Antarctica are compared to ERA5 climatologies for sea ice cover and normalized stress into the ocean, supporting the hypothesis of iceberg noise.},

abstract = {Wave interferometry is a remote sensing technique, which is increasingly employed in helioseismology, seismology, and acoustics to retrieve parameters of the propagation medium from two-point cross-correlation functions of random wavefields. Here we apply interferometry to yearlong records of seafloor pressure at 28 locations off New Zealand's South Island to investigate propagation and directivity properties of infragravity waves away from shore. A compressed cross-correlation function technique is proposed to make the interferometry of dispersive waves more robust, decrease the necessary noise averaging time, and simplify retrieval of quantitative information from noise cross correlations. The emergence of deterministic wave arrivals from cross correlations of random wavefields is observed up to the maximum range of 692 km between the pressure sensors in the array. Free, linear waves with a strongly anisotropic distribution of power flux density are found to be dominant in the infragravity wavefield. Lowest-frequency components of the infragravity wavefield are largely isotropic. The anisotropy has its maximum in the middle of the spectral band and decreases at the high-frequency end of the spectrum. Highest anisotropy peaks correspond to waves coming from portions of the New Zealand's shoreline. Significant contributions are also observed from waves propagating along the coastline and probably coming from powerful sources in the northeast Pacific. Infragravity wave directivity is markedly different to the east and to the west of the South Island. The northwest coast of the South Island is found to be a net source of the infragravity wave energy.},

Differences between observed and predicted source-to-array traveltimes are partitioned into two additive Gaussian sources, measurement error and model error, the second of which accounts for the unknown influence of wind and temperature on path. By applying the technique to both synthetic tests and ground-truth events, we highlight the complementary nature of back azimuths and arrival times for estimating well-constrained event locations.

abstract = {Various parabolic equations for advected acoustic waves have been derived based on the assumptions of small Mach number and narrow propagation angles, which are of limited validity in atmospheric acoustics. A parabolic equationsolution that does not require these assumptions is derived in the weak shear limit, which is appropriate for frequencies of about 0.1 Hz and above for atmospheric acoustics. When the variables are scaled appropriately in this limit, terms involving derivatives of the sound speed, density, and wind speed are small but can have significant cumulative effects. To obtain a solution that is valid at large distances from the source, it is necessary to account for linear terms in the first derivatives of these quantities [A. D. Pierce, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 87, 2292–2299 (1990)]. This approach is used to obtain a scalar wave equation for advected waves. Since this equation contains two depth operators that do not commute with each other, it does not readily factor into outgoing and incoming solutions. An approximate factorization is obtained that is correct to first order in the commutator of the depth operators.},

abstract = {Celerity-range models, where celerity is defined as the epicentral distance divided by the total traveltime (similar to the definition of group velocity for dispersed seismic surface waves), can be used for the association of infrasound automatic detections, for event location and for the validation of acoustic propagation simulations. Signals recorded from ground truth events are used to establish celerity-range models, but data coverage is uneven in both space and time. To achieve a high density of regional recordings we use data from USArray seismic stations recording air-to-ground coupled waves from explosions during the summers of 2004–2008 at the Utah Training and Test Range, in the western United States, together with data from five microbarograph arrays at regional distances ({\textless}1000 km). We have developed a consistent methodology for analysing the infrasound and seismic data, including choosing filter characteristics from a limited group of two-octave wide filter bands and picking the maximum peak-to-peak arrival. We clearly observe tropospheric, thermospheric and stratospheric arrivals, in agreement with regional ray tracing models. Due to data availability and the dependence of infrasound propagation on the season, we develop three regional celerity-range models for the U.S. summer, with a total of 2211 data picks. The new models suggest event locations using the Geiger method could be improved in terms of both accuracy (up to 80 per cent closer to ground truth) and precision (error ellipse area reduced by {\textgreater}90 per cent) when compared to those estimated using the global International Data Center model, particularly for events where stations detect arrivals at ranges {\textless}350 km. Whilst adding data-based prior information into the Bayesian Infrasound Source Localization (BISL) method is also shown to increase precision, to increase accuracy, the parameter space must be expanded to include station-specific celerity distributions.},

Two types of source wavelets are implemented for the experiments: blast waves and microbaroms. In both numerical experiments, the traveltimes between the receivers are accurately retrieved by applying interferometry to the synthetic barograms.

Here we first validate recent improvements in numerical modeling of microseismic compressional (P) body waves and then show how this tool allows fast detection and location of their sources. We compute sources at {\~{}}0.2 Hz within typical P teleseismic distances (30–90°) from the Southern California Seismic Network and analyze the most significant discrete sources. The locations and relative strengths of the computed sources are validated by the good agreement with beam-forming analysis. These 54 noise sources exhibit a highly heterogeneous distribution, and cluster along the usual storm tracks in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. They are mostly induced in the open ocean, at or near water depths of 2800 and 5600 km, most likely within storms or where ocean waves propagating as swell meet another swell or wind sea. We then emphasize two particularly strong storms to describe how they generate noise sources in their wake. We also use these two specific noise bursts to illustrate the differences between microseismic body and surface waves in terms of source distribution and resulting recordable ground motion. The different patterns between body and surface waves result from distinctive amplification of ocean wave-induced pressure perturbation and different seismic attenuation. Our study demonstrates the potential of numerical modeling to provide fast and accurate constraints on where and when to expect microseismic body waves, with implications for seismic imaging and climate studies.},

abstract = {Observations of the Southern Hemispheric winter conditions indicate that the major warming of September 2002 resulted from a combination of stationary wave-1 and traveling wave-2 forcing events and suggest that wave and mean-flow anomalies present earlier that winter may have also played a role. Quantities such as the location of the zero wind line, the strength and wave geometry of the vortex, and the horizontal and vertical wave fluxes all differed significantly from climatological values throughout much of the 2002 winter. An analysis of the anomalous features suggests the hypothesis that the persistence of a traveling wave 2 may have increased the likelihood of the combination with stationary wave 4, leading to the observed unprecedented increase in upward Eliassen-Palm flux preceding the warming. The anomalous conditions of the 2002 winter began as early as mid-May of that year and consisted of a large burst of wave flux into the stratosphere and a strong deceleration of the vortex during its early stage of development. The low-latitude easterly anomaly that resulted from this (unprecedented) event appears to have enhanced the poleward focusing of wave activity in the mid- and upper stratosphere during the rest of the winter. The altered wave geometry of the 2002 vortex allowed internal reflection of traveling wave 2, which helps to explain its unusual persistence during the rest of the winter.},

Clear detections were made in the Russian Federation (I45RU) and Japan (I30JP) in 2013 at stations from the International Monitoring System. Both tropospheric and stratospheric refractions arrived at the stations. In 2016, only a weak return was potentially observed at I45RU. Data analysis and propagation modeling show that the noise level at the stations and the stratospheric circumpolar vortex were different in 2016 compared to 2013. As the seismic magnitude of the 2013 and 2016 nuclear test explosions was comparable, we hypothesize that the 2016 test occurred at least 1.5 times deeper. In such a case, less seismic energy would couple through the lithosphere-atmosphere interface, leading to less observable infrasound. Since explosion depth is difficult to estimate from seismic data alone, this motivates a synergy between seismics and infrasonics.},

abstract = {Recent developments in wastewater aeration systems have focused on aeration efficiency and minimum energy cost. Many other operating characteristics are ignored. The impact of aeration system alternatives on aeration-basin temper- ature can be substantial, and design engineers should include potential effects in evaluation of alternatives. To predict aeration-basin temperature and its influence on system design, previous research has been surveyed and a spreadsheet-based computer model has been developed. Calculation has been improved significantly in the areas of heat loss from evaporation due to aeration and atmospheric radia- tion. The model was verified with 17 literature-data sets, and predicts temperature with a root-mean-squared (RMS) error of 1.24° C for these sets. The model can be used to predict aeration basin temperature for plants at different geographical locations with varying meteorological conditions for surface, subsurface, and high- purity aeration systems. The major heat loss is through evaporation from aeration, accounting for as much as 50{\%}. Heat loss from surface aerators can be twice that • of an equivalent subsurface system. Wind speed and ambient humidity are im- portant parameters in determining aeration-basin temperature.},

abstract = {Microseismic activity, recorded everywhere on Earth, is largely due to ocean waves. Recent progress has clearly identified sources of microseisms in the most energetic band, with periods from 3 to 10 s. In contrast, the generation of longer-period microseisms has been strongly debated. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain seismic wave generation: a primary mechanism, by which ocean waves propagating over bottom slopes generate seismic waves, and a secondary mechanism which relies on the nonlinear interaction of ocean waves. Here we show that the primary mechanism explains the average power, frequency distribution, and most of the variability in signals recorded by vertical seismometers, for seismic periods ranging from 13 to 300 s. The secondary mechanism only explains seismic motions with periods shorter than 13 s. Our results build on a quantitative numerical model that gives access to time-varying maps of seismic noise sources.},

abstract = {Microbaroms are a continuous infrasonic signal in the 0.15 to 0.3 Hz band caused by the collision of oceanic surface waves of equal period. Such signals are often generated by large maritime storms. Current formulation of the generation mechanism predicts that the microbarom source location due to a large maritime storm in the open ocean is generally located several hundreds of kilometers from the eye of the storm. Assuming such a source location to be correct, propagation of the microbaroms along paths which pass near the storm center as well as those which propagate away from the storm structure have been examined using geometric acoustics. Microbarom propagation paths which pass near the storm center are refracted by the storm winds and are found to have back azimuths directed toward a virtual source around the storm center. Microbarom propagation paths which do not pass near the storm center are found to have back azimuths directed toward the actual source region. To validate these predictions, data from microbarom signals generated by hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean have been collected along the east coast of the United States during the 2010 and 2011 Atlantic hurricane seasons. Data from several storm events are presented here for comparison with model predictions. In general, the observations are in agreement with the predictions of the propagation model.},

For a finite volume, one needs both volume sources and sources at the bounding surface for the extraction of the Green's functions.

abstract = {Recent advancements in infrasound monitoring hardware and software for the detection and identification of avalanche-generated infrasound signals have resulted in operation of a prototype monitoring system targeting avalanche activity occurring in the problematic slide paths that impact Wyoming State Highway 22 near Teton Pass. Implementation of the technology was facilitated in a manner aimed at providing a practical operational tool for the Wyoming Department of Transportation's avalanche hazard mitigation program. Custom sensors coupled with novel array processing have exhibited robust performance to the deafening and detrimental affects of ambient wind noise. Occurrences of false positive identification of interfering infrasound signals as significant avalanche events have been virtually eliminated through data processing discrimination methods that are based on source location features of detected signals. Performance of the automated signal discrimination methods decrease with respect to small avalanche events that do not travel far, but small events are still recognizable in system results by a skilled human interpreter. A remaining challenge is to improve the reliability of the infrasound signal path between the atmosphere and the sensor, which is covered by a variable snow pack. Upon resolving signal path issues, the technology will have reached a mature and stable state that can easily be utilized by the avalanche practitioner in appropriate applications without the need for continued extensive research and development activities.},

@article{Murphy1971,
abstract = {An expression is derived for the elastic energy produced by a contained, under- ground nuclear detonation using an analytic approximation for the pressure profile acting at the elastic radius. The resulting static strain energy and radiated energy equations are evaluated as a function of yield and depth of burial for detonations in tuff: and rhyolite. It is shown that, for a given medium, the elastic- energy efficiency depends only on the depth of burial (h) of the device and is pro- portional to h °'72. Moreover, for the particular scaling relations used, the strain energy shows the same depth dependence as the radiated energy. Seismic- spectrum scaling theory is applied to an analysis of nuclear seismic-source func- tions, giving results which are in good agreement with the observed differences in the teleseismic magnitude determinations. A magnitude-energy equation is derived for underground nuclear detonations and is noted to be in poor agreement with the Gutenberg-Richter equation. This discrepancy is interpreted to be an indi- cation that the radiated energy from small earthquakes may typically have been underestimated.},

abstract = {Getting seismic data from the deep oceans usually involves ocean-bottom seismometers, but hydrophone arrays may provide a practical alternative means of obtaining vector data. We here explore this possibility using hydrophone stations of the International Monitoring System, which have been used to study icebergs and T-wave propagation among others. These stations consist of three hydrophones at about the depth of the deep sound channel in a horizontal triangle array with 2 km sides. We use data from these stations in the very low-frequency regime (0.01-0.05 Hz band) to demonstrate that these stations can also be used as water column seismometers. By differencing the acoustic pressure, we obtain vector quantities analogous to what a seismometer would record. Comparing processed hydrophone station records of the 2004 Great Sumatra-Andaman Earthquake with broadband seismograms from a nearby island station, we find that the differenced hydrophones are indeed a practical surrogate for seismometers. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Geophysical Union.

@article{LePichon2012,
abstract = {To monitor compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test ban Treaty (CTBT), a dedicated International Monitoring System (IMS) is being deployed. Recent global scale observations recorded by this network confirm that its detection capability is highly variable in space and time. Previous studies estimated the radiated source energy from remote observations using empirical yield-scaling relations which account for the along-path stratospheric winds. Although the empirical wind correction reduces the variance in the explosive energy versus pressure relationship, strong variability remains in the yield estimate. Today, numerical modeling techniques provide a basis to better understand the role of different factors describing the source and the atmosphere that influence propagation predictions. In this study, the effects of the source frequency and the stratospheric wind speed are simulated. In order to characterize fine-scale atmospheric structures which are excluded from the current atmospheric specifications, model predictions are further enhanced by the addition of perturbation terms. A theoretical attenuation relation is thus developed from massive numerical simulations using the Parabolic Equation method. Compared with previous studies, our approach provides a more realistic physical description of long-range infrasound propagation. We obtain a new relation combining a near-field and a far-field term, which account for the effects of both geometrical spreading and absorption. In the context of the future verification of the CTBT, the derived attenuation relation quantifies the spatial and temporal variability of the IMS infrasound network performance in higher resolution, and will be helpful for the design and prioritizing maintenance of any arbitrary infrasound monitoring network.},

@article{Gobiet2007,
abstract = {This study describes and evaluates a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) retrieval scheme particularly aimed at delivering bias-free atmospheric parameters for climate monitoring and research. The focus of the retrieval is on the sensible use of a priori information for careful high-altitude initialisation in order to maximise the usable altitude range. The RO retrieval scheme has been meanwhile applied to more than five years of data (September 2001 to present) from the German CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload for geoscientific research (CHAMP) satellite. In this study it was validated against various correlative datasets including the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) and the Global Ozone Monitoring for Occultation of Stars (GOMOS) sensors on Envisat, five different atmospheric analyses, and the operational CHAMP retrieval product from GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam. In the global mean within 10 to 30 km altitude we find that the present validation observationally constrains the potential RO temperature bias to be {\textless}0.2 K. Latitudinally resolved analyses show biases to be observationally constrained to {\textless}0.2-0.5 K up to 35 km in most cases, and up to 30 km in any case, even if severely biased (about 10 K or more) a priori information is used in the high altitude initialisation of the retrieval. No evidence is found for the 10-35 km altitude range of residual RO bias sources other than those potentially propagated downward from initialisation, indicating that the widely quoted RO promise of 'unbiasedness and long-term stability due to intrinsic self-calibration' can indeed be realised given care in the data processing to strictly limit structural uncertainty. The results thus reinforce that adequate high-altitude initialisation is crucial for accurate stratospheric RO retrievals. The common method of initialising, at some altitude in the upper stratosphere, the hydrostatic integral with an upper boundary temperature or pressure value derived from meteorological analyses is prone to introduce biases from the upper boundary down to below 25 km. Also above 30 to 35 km, GNSS RO delivers a considerable amount of observed information up to around 40 km, which is particularly interesting for numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, where direct assimilation of non-initialised observed RO bending angles (free of a priori) is thus the method of choice. The results underline the value of RO for climate applications.},

abstract = {Abstract Detonations at the depth of the sound channel axis off Perth, Australia were recorded on Bermuda hydrophones at a 178°.2 range (180° is antipodal). The analysis by Shockley et al. of this 1960 transmission experiment allows for the geographic variation in the sound speed profile along the great circle path. The agreement between measured and computed travel times is within 10 s. We have modified the Shockley et al. analysis by allowing for Earth flattening and lateral refraction. The appropriate path on an ellipsoidal Earth is the geodesic, and this differs significantly from the put circle for nearly antipodal ranges. The southernmost point of the geodesic is at 52°1 S as compared to 47°.3 S for the great circle, and the geodesic travel time lags the great circle travel time by an unacceptable 34 s on account of the cold, slow waters at high southern latitudes. The effect of lateral refraction is in the opposite sense: the appropriate refracted ray path is northward of the great circle; in fact ...},

In contrast to rays, which are essentially an asymptotic, short-wave concept, energy streamlines adequately represent arbitrary wave fields. However, the usefulness of energy streamlines in studies of wave fields is limited by the fact that, unlike rays, no general laws governing energy streamline refraction are known. Here, a simple refraction law is derived for energy streamlines of acoustic and linearly polarized electromagnetic waves. It is shown that analysis of energy streamlines provides a helpful supplementary perspective on wave transmission through interfaces.},

These long-wavelength sounds can be detected over hundreds of kilometres, potentially allowing contact over large distances. Low-frequency noise from large ships (20–200 Hz) overlaps acoustic signals used by baleen whales, and increased levels of underwater noise have been documented in areas with high shipping traffic. Reported responses of whales to increased noise include: habitat displacement, behavioural changes and alterations in the intensity, frequency and intervals of calls. However, it has been unclear whether exposure to noise results in physiological responses that may lead to significant consequences for individuals or populations. Here, we show that reduced ship traffic in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, following the events of 11 September 2001, resulted in a 6 dB decrease in underwater noise with a significant reduction below 150 Hz. This noise reduction was associated with decreased baseline levels of stress-related faecal hormone metabolites (glucocorticoids) in North Atlantic right whales ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Eubalaena glacialis{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} ).

abstract = {We apply two different algorithms to measure surface wave phase velocity, as a function of frequency, from seismic ambient noise recorded at pairs of stations from a large European network. The two methods are based on consistent theoretical formulations, but differ in the implementation: one method involves the time-domain cross-correlation of signal recorded at different stations; the other is based on frequency-domain cross-correlation, and requires finding the zero-crossings of the real part of the cross-correlation spectrum. Furthermore, the time-domain method, as implemented here and in the literature, practically involves the important approximation that interstation distance be large compared to seismic wavelength. In both cases, cross-correlations are ensemble-averaged over a relatively long period of time (1 yr). We verify that the two algorithms give consistent results, and infer that phase velocity can be successfully measured through ensemble-averaging of seismic ambient noise, further validating earlier studies that had followed either approach. The description of our experiment and its results is accompanied by a detailed though simplifed derivation of ambient-noise theory, writing out explicitly the relationships between the surface wave Green's function, ambient-noise cross-correlation and phase and group velocities.},

abstract = {Two distinct groups of infrasonic waves from Saturn V, 1967, were recorded at Palisades, New York, 1485 kilometers from the launch site. The first group, of 10-minute duration, began about 70 minutes after launch time; the second, having more than twice the amplitude and a duration of 9 minutes, commenced 81 minutes after launch time. From information on the Saturn V trajectory and analysis of recorded data, it is established that the first group represents sound emitted either by the first stage reentry or by the second stage when its elevation was above 120 kilometers. The second, more intense wave group represents the sound from the powered first stage. A reversal of signal occurs because the rocket outran its own sound. Fourier analyses indicate that the energy extends to relatively long periods-10 seconds for the first stage and 7 seconds for the second. Trapping of sound in the upper atmospheric sound channel can be the cause of the separation of the signal into two distinct groups.},

abstract = {The Southern Ocean is thought to be one of the most energetic regions in the world's oceans. As a result, it is a location of vigorous diapycnal mixing of heat, salt and biogeochemical properties. At the same time, the Southern Ocean is poorly sampled, not least because of its harsh climate and remote location. Yet the spatial and temporal variation of diapycnal diffusivity in this region plays an important part in the large-scale ocean circulation and climate. Here we use high-resolution hydrographic profiles from Argo floats in combination with the Iridium communications system to investigate diapycnal mixing in the Southern Ocean. We find that the spatial distribution of turbulent diapycnal mixing in the Southern Ocean at depths between 300 and 1,800-m is controlled by the topography, by means of its interaction with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The seasonal variation of this mixing can largely be attributed to the seasonal cycle of surface wind stress and is more pronounced in the upper ocean over flat topography. We suggest that additional high-resolution profiles from Argo floats will serve to advance our understanding of mixing processes in the global ocean interior. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Summary The coherence of atmospheric acoustic-gravity waves has been measured in the period range 10–100 s at the Large Aperture Microbarograph Array in south-eastern Montana. The acoustic-gravity waves observed were signals generated by presumed nuclear explosions. The decrease of coherence with increasing distance between pairs of microbarographs is less rapid in the direction of wave propagation than transverse to it. Variation of direction of arrival over a small range of azimuth (±5°) explains the spatial behaviour of coherence in the direction normal to the wave propagation; variation of phase velocity of ±10 ms-1 explains the behaviour along the direction of wave propagation. Both effects may be due to inhomogeneities in the atmosphere; the velocity variation may be due to the presence in the signal of several normal modes of acoustic- gravity waves, each travelling at a slightly different phase velocity in the range 300–330 ms-1.},

@article{Barnes1993,
abstract = {Fourier power spectra are often usefully characterized by average measures. In reflection seismology, the important average measures are center frequency, spectral bandwidth, and dominant frequency. These quantities have definitions familiar from probability theory: center frequency is the spectral mean, spectral bandwidth is the standard deviation about that mean, and dominant frequency is the square root of the second moment, which serves as an estimate of the zero?crossing frequency. These measures suggest counterparts defined with instantaneous power spectra in place of Fourier power spectra, so that they are instantaneous in time though they represent averages in frequency. Intuitively reasonable requirements yield specific forms for these instantaneous quantities that can be computed with familiar complex seismic trace attributes. Instantaneous center frequency is just instantaneous frequency. Instantaneous bandwidth is the absolute value of the derivative of the instantaneous amplitude divided by the instantaneous amplitude. Instantaneous dominant frequency is the square root of the sum of the squares of the instantaneous frequency and instantaneous bandwidth. Instantaneous bandwidth and dominant frequency find employment as additional complex seismic trace attributes in the detailed study of seismic data. Instantaneous bandwidth is observed to be nearly always less than instantaneous frequency; the points where it is larger may mark the onset of distinct wavelets. These attributes, together with instantaneous frequency, are perhaps, of greater use in revealing the time?varying spectral properties of seismic data. They can help in the search for low frequency shadows or in the analysis of frequency change due to effects of data processing. Instantaneous bandwidth and dominant frequency complement instantaneous frequency and should find wide application in the analysis of seismic reflection data.},

abstract = {Cross-correlation of ambient seismic noise recorded by two seismic stations may result in an estimate of the Green's function between those two receivers. Several authors have recently attempted to measure attenuation based on these interferometric, receiver-receiver surface waves. By now, however, it is well established that the loss of coherence of the cross-correlation as a function of space depends strongly on the excitation of the medium. In fact, in a homogeneous dissipative medium, uniform excitation is required to correctly recover attenuation. Applied to fundamental-mode ambient seismic surface waves, this implies that the cross-correlation will decay at the local attenuation rate only if noise sources are distributed uniformly on the Earth's surface. In this study we show that this constraint can be relaxed in case the observed loss of coherence is due to multiple scattering instead of dissipation of energy. We describe the scattering medium as an effective medium whose phase velocity and rate of attenuation are a function of the scatterer density and the average strength of the scatterers. We find that the decay of the cross-correlation in the effective medium coincides with the local attenuation of the effective medium in case the scattering medium is illuminated uniformly from all angles. Consequently, uniform excitation is not a necessary condition for the correct retrieval of scattering attenuation. We exemplify the implications of this finding for studies using the spectrally whitened cross-correlation to infer subsurface attenuation.},

abstract = {Infrasound array data are commonly used to detect and characterize infrasonic signals from a variety of natural and anthropogenic sources. Here we examine the effectiveness of robust regression estimators (L1-norm regression, M-estimators and least trimmed squares) for infrasound array processing, and compare them against standard array processing algorithms (least-squares estimation, frequency–wavenumber analysis and progressive multi-channel correlation) using a combination of real and synthetic data. Of particular interest is how each algorithm performs when one of the array elements produces data outliers. Synthetic tests on elements containing a clock error, constant values or only pink noise are performed, and we analyse the relative ability of the estimators to recover plane wave parameters. The L1-norm regression, M-estimate, frequency–wavenumber analysis and least trimmed squares estimates provided superior results than conventional least-squares estimation. Evaluation of least trimmed squares weights consistently identified the element with the simulated error, providing additional information on array performance. Least trimmed squares processing consistently identified an element with reversed polarity for Alaska Volcano Observatory array ADKI. International Monitoring System stations IS57 and IS55 were likewise processed. Data from an element of IS57, which had lower cross-correlation values than the remaining elements, were consistently identified as having outliers in array processing. An element with a timing error was identified in the analysis of IS55 data. These results suggest robust regression methods, in particular least trimmed squares, improve upon standard methods and should be used more widely, as they can provide robust array processing results and insight into array performance. Further, robust regression methods are not limited to infrasound array processing applications, and it is likely that they would also be effective for seismic array data.},

abstract = {Numerical calculation of infrasound propagation paths is necessary to support accurate infrasound source location and phase identification. Predicting the details of infrasound propagation relies both on propagation models that capture the fundamental physical processes and on characterization of the propagation medium, namely the global atmosphere from the ground to altitudes above 100 km. The accuracy of propagation modeling depends in part on the fidelity of the atmospheric characterization. The analysis tool kit InfraMAP (Infrasound Modeling of Atmospheric Propagation) integrates infrasound propagation models and environmental representations, including synoptic updates of the atmospheric specification, such as the output from numerical weather prediction models that supplement the baseline climatological characterization of temperature, wind and air composition. These capabilities allow infrasound researchers to investigate critical propagation phenomena, conduct sensitivity studies, and compare results of numerical modeling with observed signals. Recent efforts investigate combining accurate, high-resolution regional atmospheric specifications with infrasound propagation modeling codes. Mesoscale models, which focus on the meteorology of a specific region, can account for and resolve important meteorological phenomena relevant to regional and local infrasound propagation. By investigating realistic spatial and temporal atmospheric models at a range of resolutions, we seek insight into the appropriate spatial and temporal scales that are necessary for achieving improved infrasound predictions at the relevant frequencies. Approaches are being developed to assess performance of candidate techniques for incorporating mesoscale atmospheric models and terrain specifications with propagation models and to evaluate the benefits for infrasound monitoring.},

abstract = {The detection and characterization of signals of interest in the presence of (in)coherent ambient noise is central to the analysis of infrasound array data. Microbaroms have an extended source region and a dynamical character. From the perspective of an infrasound array, these coherent noise sources appear as interfering signals that conventional beamform methods may not correctly resolve. This limits the ability of an infrasound array to dissect the incoming wavefield into individual components. In this paper, this problem will be addressed by proposing a high-resolution beamform technique in combination with the CLEAN algorithm. CLEAN iteratively selects the maximum of the f/k spectrum (i.e. following the Bartlett or the Capon method) and removes a percentage of the corresponding signal from the cross-spectral density matrix. In this procedure, the array response is deconvolved from the f/k spectral density function. The spectral peaks are retained in a ‘clean' spectrum. A data-driven stopping criterion for CLEAN is proposed, which relies on the framework of Fisher statistics. This allows the construction of an automated algorithm that continuously extracts coherent energy until the point is reached that only incoherent noise is left in the data. CLEAN is tested on a synthetic data set and is applied to data from multiple International Monitoring System infrasound arrays. The results show that the proposed method allows for the identification of multiple microbarom source regions in the Northern Atlantic that would have remained unidentified if conventional methods had been applied.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent evidence of strong stratospheric-tropospheric coupling during the Northern Hemisphere winter, this study examines the evolution of the atmospheric flow and wave fluxes at levels throughout the stratosphere and troposphere during the composite life cycle of a sudden stratospheric warming. The composite comprises 39 major and minor warming events using 44 years of NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data. The incipient stage of the life cycle is characterized by preconditioning of the stratospheric zonal flow and anomalous, quasi-stationary wavenumber-1 forcing in both the stratosphere and troposphere. As the life cycle intensifies, planetary wave driving gives rise to weakening of the stratospheric polar vortex and downward propagation of the attendant easterly wind and positive temperature anomalies. When these anomalies reach the tropopause, the life cycle is marked by momentum flux and mean meridional circulation anomalies at tropospheric levels that are consistent with the negative phase of the Northern Hemisphere annular mode. The anomalous momentum fluxes are largest over the Atlantic half of the hemisphere and are associated primarily with waves of wavenumber 3 and higher.},

abstract = {The International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasound network is being deployed to ensure compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). Recent global scale observations recorded by this network confirm that its detection capability is highly variable in space and time. Previous studies estimated the radiated source energy from remote observations using empirical yield-scaling relations which account for the along-path stratospheric winds. Although these relations reduce the variance in the explosive energy yield estimates, large error remains. Today, numerical modeling techniques provide a basis to better predict the effects of the source and middle atmospheric dynamic parameters on propagation. In order to account for a realistic description of the dynamic structure of the atmosphere, model predictions are further enhanced by wind and temperature error distributions as measured by high-resolution middle atmospheric sounding techniques. In the context of the future verification of the CTBT, these predictions quantify uncertainties of the IMS infrasound network performance in higher resolution, and are helpful for the design and prioritizing maintenance of any arbitrary infrasound monitoring network.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Between 0.1 and 0.5 Hz, infrasound signals recorded in the atmosphere are dominated by ocean-generated noise called microbaroms. Microbaroms propagate through the atmosphere over thousands of kilometres due to low absorption and efficient ducting between the ground and the stratopause. Different theoretical models have been developed to characterize the source of microbaroms, all based on the second-order nonlinear interaction of ocean waves. While early theories considered an infinite ocean depth and a source radiation depending on the acoustic wave elevation angle, other works have approximated the radiation pattern as a monopole, and found a considerable effect of the water depth. This paper reviews these models and extends the previous theories to the combined effects of both finite depth ocean and source directivity in both elevation and azimuth angles. It is found that the water depth has a negligible effect for the near-horizontally propagating acoustic waves that should dominate the measured microbarom records. Another important result is that the microbarom azimuthal variation can be highly directive locally, but it generally becomes isotropic when integrated over a realistic source region.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To enhance the phase arrivals in stacks, we apply short-time window average over long-time window average filtering to individual traces before stacking. Although the T phase arrival is visible in stacks from seismograms filtered at 0.5-5 Hz, it appears much stronger at higher frequencies (2-8 Hz) and is further enhanced by only stacking seismograms from oceanic paths. Stacking only subsets of the data depending on continental path lengths on the receiver side shows that the T phase can be observed at stations up to 4° inland from the coast, and changes in the T phase arrival time correspond to reasonable crustal velocities.},

abstract = {A global-scale analysis of detections made at all 36 currently operating International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasound arrays confirms that the primary factor controlling signal detectability is the seasonal variability of the stratospheric zonal wind. At most arrays, {\&}{\#}8764;80{\%} of the detections in the 0.2- to 2-Hz bandpass are associated with propagation downwind of the dominant stratospheric wind direction. Previous IMS infrasound network performance models neglect the time- and site-dependent effects of both stratospheric meteorological variability and ambient noise models. In this study both effects are incorporated; we compare empirical and improved specifications of the stratospheric wind and include station-dependent wind noise models. Using a deterministic approach, the influence of individual model parameters on the network performance is systematically assessed. At frequencies of interest for detecting atmospheric explosions (0.2-2 Hz), the simulations predict that explosions equivalent to{\~{}}500 t of TNT would be detected by at least two stations at any time of the year. The detection capability is best around January and July when stratospheric winds are strongest, compared to the equinox periods when zonal winds reduce and reverse. The model predicts that temporal fluctuations in the ground-to-stratosphere meteorological variables generate detection threshold variations on daily and seasonal timescales of {\~{}}50 and {\~{}}500 t, respectively. While the strong zonal winds lead to an improvement in detection capability, their highly directional nature leads to an increase in the location uncertainty owing to the decreased azimuthal separation of the detecting stations.},

Confidence in the assessment for the time period since 1971 is high based on increased data coverage after this date and on a high level of agreement among independent observations of subsurface temperature [3.2], sea surface temperature [2.4.2], and sea level rise, which is known to include a substantial component due to thermal expansion [3.7, Chapter 13]. There is less certainty in changes prior to 1971 because of relatively sparse sampling in earlier time periods. The strongest warming is found near the sea surface (0.11 [0.09 to 0.13]°C per decade in the upper 75 m between 1971 and 2010), decreasing to about 0.015°C per decade at 700 m. It is very likely that the surface intensification of this warming signal increased the thermal stratification of the upper ocean by about 4{\%} between 0 and 200 m depth.

The MIL event occurs in the altitude region {\~{}}79-84 km with an inversion amplitude of {\~{}}50 K and thickness of 4.5 km. The two dimensional spectral analysis on the temperature perturbations shows the presence of a dominant gravity wave with vertical wavelength of 6.4 km and the period of 38 min in the height region of {\~{}}30.0-55.0 km and shorter period of 33 min above 55.0 km. The other characteristics of the gravity wave have been obtained from the gravity wave dispersion relation using rocketsonde winds over SHAR (13.7°N, 80.2°E) and medium frequency (MF) radar winds over Tirunelveli (8.7°N, 77.8°E) in the altitude regions 25-65 km and 80-90 km respectively. The horizontal phase speed and wavelength of the wave are found to be {\~{}}50 m/s and {\~{}}110 km in the height region of 30.0-55.0 km and {\~{}}57 m/s and {\~{}}129 km above 55.0 km respectively indicating the dominant presence of internal gravity wave, rather than inertia-gravity wave. In this study, the condition for gravity wave saturation is checked from the ratio of wave amplitude to the saturation amplitude and it is found that, above 80 km, the gravity wave amplitude gets saturated in the inversion region indicating the wave dissipation, which subsequently can lead to turbulence, cooling and heating. The eddy diffusion coefficient increases from {\~{}}54 m2/s to {\~{}}284m2/s in the inversion region and above this height, it decreases. The theoretically computed heating rate due to turbulence generated by gravity wave breaking in the MIL compares well with observations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Fundamentals of Physical Acoustics is intended for a two-semester, first-year graduate course, but is also suitable for advanced undergraduates. Emphasis on plane waves in the first part of the book keeps the mathematics simple yet accommodates a broad range of topics: propagation, reflection and transmission, normal modes and simple waveguides for rectilinear geometries, horns, inhomogeneous media, and sound absorption and dispersion. The second part of the book is devoted to a more rigorous development of the wave equation, spherical and cylindrical waves (including the more advanced mathematics required), advanced waveguides, baffled piston radiation, diffraction (treated in the time domain), and arrays. Applications and examples are drawn from: Atmospheric acoustics Noise control Underwater acoustics Engineering acoustics Acoustical measurements Supplemented with more than 300 graphs and figures as well as copious end-of-chapter problems, Fundamentals of Physical Acoustics is also an excellent professional reference for engineers and scientists.},

For 66{\%}/88{\%} of Earth's surface area the detection threshold is lower than that expected for the windless case for all/≥90{\%} of the time. However, preferential downwind detection makes location of explosions with yields close to the threshold more difficult due to the restricted azimuthal coverage. Completing the IMS network is also important: the detection threshold for the 39 station network operating in October 2008 is approximately 45{\%} higher than that predicted for the full 59 station network. Moreover, the absolute detection threshold values are highly sensitive to the frequency band in which the noise is evaluated. A detector simulation comprising overlapping two-octave frequency bands indicates that, when accounting for low noise at frequencies above 0.2 Hz, detection capability at low yields ({\textless}0.5 kt) may be considerably better than previously estimated. Our simulations, using a two-octave bandwidth detector and incorporating stratospheric winds from a climatological model, predict that explosions of {\textgreater}210 t chemical explosive ({\textgreater}420 t nuclear equivalent yield) will be detected over ≥95{\%} of Earth's surface at any time of year (with a 90{\%} probability).},

abstract = {Infrasound and longer-period acoustic gravity waves have been of considerable interest since barometers around the world inadvertently recorded infrasound from the 1883 eruption of Krakatau (Evers and Haak 2010). Early recordings showed that, at low frequencies, there is relatively little intrinsic attenuation, facilitating the detection and characterization of large events over great ranges (e.g., Landau and Lifshitz 1959). Infrasound was used to locate enemy artillery in WWI. Infrasound was used as a monitoring tool during the early proliferation of nuclear weapon technologies after WWII when nuclear tests were routinely conducted in the atmosphere. In 1963, the Limited Test Ban Treaty was signed by most nations, and nuclear testing generally went underground. Interest in infrasound as a moni- toring tool waned as interest in global seismology increased.},

abstract = {The study of infrasound is experiencing a renaissance since it was chosen as a verification technique for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The success of the verification technique strongly depends on knowledge of upper atmospheric processes. The ability of infrasound to probe the upper atmosphere starts to be exploited, taking the field beyond its monitoring application. Processes in the stratosphere couple to the troposphere and influence our daily weather and climate. Infrasound delivers actual observations on the state of the stratosphere with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we show the infrasonic signature, passively obtained, of a drastic change in the stratosphere due to the major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) of January 2009. With this study, we infer the enormous capacity of infrasound in acoustic remote sensing of stratospheric processes on a global scale with surface based instruments. Citation: Evers, L. G., and P.

Although the nearly sinusoidal pressure variations show good coherence among the stations, there is enough wave breakdown among the stations to suggest interference from a widespread source. Other factors indicate this source to be ocean waves. It is concluded that the spectral character of both microbaroms and microseisms is a function of a common generating mechanism, but microbarom amplitude variations depend also on atmospheric conditions along the path.},

abstract = {Abstract Observations of natural infrasound produce a continual record of the sound velocity, a function of wind and temperature, at the reflection level in the upper atmosphere. Under normal conditions in winter the reflection level, for sound generated by ocean waves to the east of Palisades, N. Y., is in the lower thermosphere. During the circulation changes associated with stratospheric warmings, winds near the stratopause may become east or north, allowing infrasound to be reflected from this level. We are then provided with a continuous record of sound velocity near the stratopause. The methods which are used to distinguish between stratosphere and thermospheric sound reflection are discussed, and circulation changes for each year are cataloged. During the warming event sound velocities in the stratosphere are shown to vary radically, with fluctuations of up to 60 m s?1 in a few hours time period. These short time period variations, observable only because of the continuous nature of infrasound recording, are greater than expected and indeed constitute a significant fraction of the total wind and temperature variation associated with the event at our latitude. As such they imply significant energy variations on shorter time scales than those usually considered important in stratospheric dynamics. Some possible explanations for these observations are given.},

As a consequence, it is predominantly useful when receivers are il- luminated from one side only. This puts constraints on the ap- plicability of SI by MDD to omnidirectional wave fields. The proposed modification eliminates the requirement to separate inward-and outward propagating wave field and, consequently, improves the applicability of MDD to omnidirectional wave fields.

The propagation of internal gravity waves caused by atmospheric heating due to water-vapor condensation during the formation of a convective cloud is simulated. The results of calculations show that the lifetime of these internal gravity waves may significantly exceed the lifetime of this cloud.

@incollection{Pedlosky,
abstract = {The focus of my attention in this essay is to give the reader some insight into the development of the theoretical ideas concerning the thermocline from the very personal point of view of someone involved in that development. It is not a review paper of the full scientific history of the subject or a detailed scientific discussion of the problem. Rather, I want to present the more personal side of the history of the attempt to reach an understanding of the phenomenon of the thermocline. In that special sense this is a personal memoir of my involvement in that quest and I hope to capture the flavor of that experience for others. It culminated for me in the development of the theory of the Ventilated Thermocline, a theory that evolved in collaboration with Henry Stommel and Jim Luyten and so the story is one person's view of what was a collegial effort. The presence of the thermocline, the region of rapid increase of density with depth in the first one or two kilometers of the subtropical oceans, has been recognized for a long time.Yet looking back at the older literature it is hard to find a reference to the problem of the thermocline, that is, in explaining the maintenance of this sharp density gradient or its cause. The thermocline itself is bowl-shaped in the meridional plane and contains fairly entirely the wind-driven currents of the major subtropical gyres so there is much to explain. It is provocative to note that the very word does not even appear in the index of that great tome, The Oceans, by Sverdrup, Johnson, and Fleming (1942) which was for a long time the definitive work on oceanography although the word appears a few times1 in the text. More frequently, the thermocline is referred to there as a "discontinuity layer" or "transition layer." This makes the thermocline appear as a curious secondary feature separating zones of greater oceanographic interest. Similarly in Defant's two-volume treatise on physical oceanography (1961), the thermocline is noted largely as a transition zone between what are supposed to be oceanographic analogues of the atmosphere's troposphere and stratosphere. The existence of such a transition layer is taken, misleadingly, as a natural process similar to the seasonal thermocline in lakes. Indeed, the first use of the word "thermocline" appears in the limnology literature of the late nineteenth century, a fact for which I am indebted to my colleague Bruce Warren. It does seem like one of those examples, not uncommon in science, in which a phenomenon is noted but that it might be a problem requires first that it be posed as a problem, i.e., why should there be a permanent thermocline in the ocean? It is a bit like becoming used to looking at the Rocky Mountains and taking their presence for granted. It may not be natural for most people in their neighborhood to ask why they are there but once the question is asked it is easy to realize the importance of finding the answer. Of course it is a danger of amateur historiography to overlook past insights into a scientific problem that contributed to a background understanding but which often enter into oblivion because these insights were not united to a powerful enough method to obtain a complete solution to the problem. So, for example, the insightful work of Montgomery (1938), in which it is pointed out that the water mass properties at depth in the subtropical gyre can be traced back along an isopycnal to the properties of surface water, was an idea clearly influenced by the meteorological interest of the time in isentropic analysis of atmospheric motions suggested by Rossby (1937). This idea is seen in even more explicit form in the interpretive work of Iselin (1936, 1939) whose much reproduced schematic shows explicitly how water from the mixed layer sliding down along isopycnal surfaces sets the vertical distribution of density (and so implicitly also its horizontal distribution) in the subtropical gyres. These very profound insights were, however, innocent of a powerfully enough unifying dynamical foundation that could go beyond a quasi-diagnostic explanation to provide the basis for a theoretical understanding of thermocline structure. Interestingly enough, the key ingredient has turned out to be potential vorticity conservation and this was much on the minds of Rossby and Montgomery who had collaborated on its application to atmospheric motions. A similar application to oceanic motion had to wait another 40 years.2 In the years that followed there were few attempts to deal with the structure of the thermocline except for some linear models (Stommel andVeronis, 1957; Pedlosky, 1969; Gill, 1985) that attempted to describe the capture of the wind-driven motion to an upper region of the ocean while accepting an already specified background stratification as a starting point for the linearization of the theory. Such treatments, interesting in their own right, are clearly incapable of addressing the fundamental question of the density structure that defines the thermocline. They do, however, have the virtue of indicating the beta-effect as being the important dynamical mechanism for limiting the depth of penetration below the upper sea surface of the wind-driven motion. The principal issue is easily stated. The ocean is heated nonuniformly but persistently at the sea surface. How is it, then, that the signature of that forcing penetrates to only about 20{\%} of the total ocean depth even though the heating has gone on for millions of years? Clearly, a dynamical process is required to trap the thermal signal to the upper ocean, but what specifically is the operating mechanism? {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc., All rights reserved.},

Climate-induced changes in ocean temperature (and hence in sound speed) can be monitored by measuring travel time changes of acoustic signals from remote powerful sources. Warming induced now at the sound axis by CO2 and other greenhouse gases is estimated at 0.005°C per year, too small to be measured locally in the presence of 1°C rms noise from gyre scale and mesoscale fluctuations. The associated rate of decrease in travel time from greenhouse warming (a global measure of temperature rise) is estimated at 0.1 to 0.2 s per year. This climatic signal should be detectable above the gyre and mesoscale noise (less than 1 s rms), given a program of measurements carried out over a decade.

abstract = {Reliable estimation of the size or density of wild animal populations is very important for effective wildlife management, conservation and ecology. Currently, the most widely used methods for obtaining such estimates involve either sighting animals from transect lines or some form of capture-recapture on marked or uniquely identifiable individuals. However, many species are difficult to sight, and cannot be easily marked or recaptured. Some of these species produce readily identifiable sounds, providing an opportunity to use passive acoustic data to estimate animal density. In addition, even for species for which other visually based methods are feasible, passive acoustic methods offer the potential for greater detection ranges in some environments (e.g. underwater or in dense forest), and hence potentially better precision. Automated data collection means that surveys can take place at times and in places where it would be too expensive or dangerous to send human observers. Here, we present an overview of animal density estimation using passive acoustic data, a relatively new and fast-developing field. We review the types of data and methodological approaches currently available to researchers and we provide a framework for acoustics-based density estimation, illustrated with examples from real-world case studies. We mention moving sensor platforms (e.g. towed acoustics), but then focus on methods involving sensors at fixed locations, particularly hydrophones to survey marine mammals, as acoustic-based density estimation research to date has been concentrated in this area. Primary among these are methods based on distance sampling and spatially explicit capture-recapture. The methods are also applicable to other aquatic and terrestrial sound-producing taxa. We conclude that, despite being in its infancy, density estimation based on passive acoustic data likely will become an important method for surveying a number of diverse taxa, such as sea mammals, fish, birds, amphibians, and insects, especially in situations where inferences are required over long periods of time. There is considerable work ahead, with several potentially fruitful research areas, including the development of (i) hardware and software for data acquisition, (ii) efficient, calibrated, automated detection and classification systems, and (iii) statistical approaches optimized for this application. Further, survey design will need to be developed, and research is needed on the acoustic behaviour of target species. Fundamental research on vocalization rates and group sizes, and the relation between these and other factors such as season or behaviour state, is critical. Evaluation of the methods under known density scenarios will be important for empirically validating the approaches presented here. {\textcopyright} 2012 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

Using data from 150 continuously recording stations in Europe, the C3 results help in the extraction of the travel-times from noise-based measurements, especially through the suppression of effects caused by non-isotropic source distributions. We present the results of the next iterative step (i.e. C5), which show that some coherent signal is still present in the coda of the C3 function, and we investigate the evolution of the reconstruction of the Green's function throughout the iteration process.

Of the 43 arrays certified as of 2011 January, I14CL on Juan Fernandez Island has the greatest topography across an array, with a least-squares fitted plane through the array elements having an 8.1° slope from the horizontal (compared to a network mean of 1.6°). Beamforming errors (both backazimuth and apparent velocity) are a function of the arrival azimuth and become increasingly large for steeply inclined arrivals, such that systematic errors will be significantly larger for signals returned from the thermosphere compared to those from the stratosphere. At several arrays, azimuthal errors due to array topography are comparable in magnitude to deviations often associated with atmospheric propagation. These findings are illustrated using signals recorded in Greenland at I18DK, where differences between results processed using both full 3-D array geometry and the 2-D (topography neglected) approximation exhibit good correspondence to theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {Abstract A three-dimensional model is developed to study the behavior of the solar semidiurnal tide in the thermosphere. In this model, we include viscosity, thermal conductivity, Coriolis effects, the sphericity of the earth, and ion drag. Sources of excitation are absorption of solar radiation by H2O and O2 below the mesopause, and by O2 in the Schumann-Runge continuum, and O, O2, N2 in the extreme ultraviolet, in the thermosphere. The effects of mean wind below the thermosphere are obtained by joining our present results to the relevant solutions obtained by Lindzen and Hong (1974) at 100 km, modified, however, by the use of improved and corrected heating functions. Our calculations provide detailed predictions for all meteorological fields as functions of season, solar cycle, and other parameters. Among our findings are the following: In the present calculations, the semidiurnal tide between 100 and 130 km is dominated by the 2,4 mode excited below the thermosphere.

During a sustained explosive volcanic eruption, it is typical to record a sustained broadband signal on seismometers, termed eruption tremor. Eruption tremor is usually attributed to a subsurface seismic source process, such as the upward migration of magma and gases through the shallow conduit and vent. However, it is now known that sustained explosive volcanic eruptions also generate powerful tremor signals in the atmosphere, termed infrasonic tremor. We investigate infrasonic tremor coupling down into the ground and its contribution to the observed seismic tremor. Our methodology builds on that proposed by Ichihara et al.

abstract = {The coexistence in the deep ocean of a finite, stable stratification, a strong meridional overturning circulation, and mesoscale eddies raises complex questions concerning the circulation energetics. In particular, small-scale mixing processes are necessary to resupply the potential energy removed in the interior by the overturning and eddy-generating process. A number of lines of evidence, none complete, suggest that the oceanic general circulation, far from being a heat engine, is almost wholly governed by the forcing of the wind field and secondarily by deep water tides. In detail however, the budget of mechanical energy input into the ocean is poorly constrained. The now inescapable conclusion that over most of the ocean significant “vertical” mixing is confined to topographically complex boundary areas implies a potentially radically different interior circulation than is possible with uniform mixing. Whether ocean circulation models, either simple box or full numerical ones, neither explicitly accounting for the energy input into the system nor providing for spatial variability in the mixing, have any physical relevance under changed climate conditions is at issue.},

Radio Occultation (RO) using Global Positioning System (GPS) signals is based on time measurements with precise atomic clocks. It provides a long-term stable and consistent data record with global coverage and favorable error characteristics. Highest quality and vertical resolution is given in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). RO data exist from the GPS/Met mission within 1995–1997, and continuous observations are available since 2001. We give a review on studies using RO data for climate monitoring and change detection in the UTLS and discuss RO characteristics and error estimates, climate change indicators, trend detection, and comparison to conventional upper-air data. These studies showed that RO parameters cover the whole UTLS with useful indicators of climate change, being most robust in the tropics. Refractivity is most sensitive in the lower stratosphere (LS) and tropopause region, pressure/geopotential height and temperature over the UTLS region. An emerging climate change signal in the RO record can be detected for geopotential height of pressure levels and for temperature, reflecting warming of the troposphere and cooling of the LS. The results are in agreement with trends in radiosonde and ERA-Interim records. Climate model trends basically agree as well but they show less warming/cooling contrast across the tropical tropopause. (Advanced) Microwave Sounding Unit LS bulk temperature anomalies show significant differences to RO. Overall, the quality of RO climate records is suitable to fulfill the requirements of a global climate change monitoring system.},

abstract = {Arrays of hydrophones were deployed within the Bransfield Strait and Scotia Sea (Antarctic Peninsula region) from 2005 to 2009 to record ambient ocean sound at frequencies of up to 125 and 500 Hz. Icequakes, which are broadband, short duration signals derived from fracturing of large free-floating icebergs, are a prominent feature of the ocean soundscape. Icequake activity peaks during austral summer and is minimum during winter, likely following freeze-thaw cycles. Iceberg grounding and rapid disintegration also releases significant acoustic energy, equivalent to large-scale geophysical events. Overall ambient sound levels can be as much as {\~{}}10-20 dB higher in the open, deep ocean of the Scotia Sea compared to the relatively shallow Bransfield Strait. Noise levels become lowest during the austral winter, as sea-ice cover suppresses wind and wave noise. Ambient noise levels are highest during austral spring and summer, as surface noise, ice cracking and biological activity intensifies. Vocalizations of blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and fin (B. physalus) whales also dominate the long-term spectra records in the 15-28 and 89 Hz bands. Blue whale call energy is a maximum during austral summer-fall in the Drake Passage and Bransfield Strait when ambient noise levels are a maximum and sea-ice cover is a minimum. Fin whale vocalizations were also most common during austral summer-early fall months in both the Bransfield Strait and Scotia Sea. The hydrophone data overall do not show sustained anthropogenic sources (ships and airguns), likely due to low coastal traffic and the typically rough weather and sea conditions of the Southern Ocean.},

abstract = {Abstract The primary goal of this study is to explore the potential for estimating the vertical velocity (VV) of air from the surface to the stratosphere, using widely available radiosonde and dropsonde data. The rise and fall rates of radiosondes and dropsondes, respectively, are a combination of the VV of the atmosphere and still-air rise–fall rates. The still-air rise–fall rates are calculated using basic fluid dynamics and characteristics of radiosonde and dropsonde systems. This study validates the technique to derive the VV from radiosonde and dropsonde data and demonstrates its value. This technique can be easily implemented by other users for various scientific applications. The technique has been applied to the Terrain-induced Rotor Experiment (T-REX) dropsonde and radiosonde data. Comparisons among radiosonde, dropsonde, aircraft, and profiling radar vertical velocities show that the sonde-estimated VV is able to capture and describe events with strong vertical motions (larger than ∼1 m s−1) obs...},

The Interaction of Ocean Waves and Wind describes in detail the two-way interaction between wind and ocean waves and shows how ocean waves affect weather forecasting on timescales of 5 to 90 days. Winds generate ocean waves, but at the same time airflow is modified due to the loss of energy and momentum to the waves; thus, momentum loss from the atmosphere to the ocean depends on the state of the waves. This volume discusses ocean wave evolution according to the energy balance equation. An extensive overview of nonlinear transfer is given, and as a by-product the role of four-wave interactions in the generation of extreme events, such as freak waves, is discussed. Effects on ocean circulation are described. Coupled ocean-wave, atmosphere modelling gives improved weather and wave forecasts. This volume will interest ocean wave modellers, physicists and applied mathematicians, and engineers interested in shipping and coastal protection.},

abstract = {This is the first part of a two-part article that uses three methods to estimate observation errors and their correlations for clear-sky sounder radiances used in the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) assimilation system. The analysis is based on covariances derived from pairs of first-guess and analysis departures. The methods used are the so-called Hollingsworth/L{\~{A}}{\P}nnberg method, a method based on subtracting a scaled version of mapped assumed background errors from first-guess departure covariances and the Desroziers diagnostic. The present article reports the results for the three Advanced TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS) instruments: the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU)-A, High-Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) and Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS).The findings suggest that all AMSU-A sounding channels show little or no interchannel or spatial observation-error correlations, except for surface-sensitive channels over land. Estimates for the observation error are mostly close to the instrument noise. In contrast, HIRS temperature-sounding channels exhibit some interchannel error correlations, and these are stronger for surface-sensitive channels. There are also indications for stronger spatial-error correlations for the HIRS short-wave channels. There is good agreement between the estimates from the three methods for temperature-sounding channels.Estimating observation errors for humidity-sounding channels of MHS and HIRS appears more difficult. A considerable proportion of the observation error for humidity-sounding channels appears correlated spatially for short separation distances, as well as between channels. Observation error estimates for humidity channels are generally considerably larger than the instrument noise.Observation error estimates from this study are consistently lower than those assumed in the ECMWF assimilation system. As error correlations are small for AMSU-A, the study suggests that the current use of AMSU-A data in the ECMWF system in terms of observation-error or thinning-scale choices is fairly conservative.

For the entire time span the nowcast generally performs best, indicated by a higher continuity of the predicted wavefront characteristics with a minimal back azimuth difference. Best performance for all forecasts is obtained in summer.

A canonical form, that of a pair of arrivals, for ground returns of impulsive signals in a stratospheric duct is determined. The canonical form is derived from the geometrical acoustics approximation, and is validated and extended through full wave
modeling. The full caustic structure of the field of ray paths is found and used to determine phase relations between the contributions to the wavetrain from different propagation paths. Finally, comparison with data collected from the 2005 fuel gas depot explosion in Buncefield, England is made. The correspondence between the theoretical results and the observations is shown to be quite good.},

abstract = {The 2017 North Korean nuclear test gave rise to seismic and low-frequency acoustic signals, that is, infrasound. The infra- sonic signals are due to seismo-acoustic coupling and have been detected on microbarometer array I45RU in the Russian Federation at 401 km from the test site. I45RU is part of the International Monitoring System for the verification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We analyze the seismo-acoustic coupling by making use of array-processing and backprojection techniques. The backprojections show that infrasound radiation is not confined to the epicentral region. More distant regions are found to be consistent with locations of topography, sedimentary basins, and underwater evanescent sources. The backprojections can be used to estimate the average infrasonic propagation speed through the atmosphere. We discuss these findings in the context of infrasound propagation conditions during the sixth nuclear test. It is suggested that propagation from the test site to I45RU may have occurred along unexpected paths instead of typical stratospheric propagation. We present several scenarios that could be considered in the interpretation of the observations.},

During May 2011, it erupted over a period of 5 days, with explosive activity directly linked to the generation of seismoacoustic T phases. We show, using cross-correlation and time-difference-of-arrival techniques, that the eruption is detected as far as Ascension Island, equatorial South Atlantic Ocean, where a bottom moored hydrophone array is operated as part of the International Monitoring System of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization. Hydroacoustic phases from the volcanic center must therefore have propagated through the Sound Fixing and Ranging channel in the South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans, a source-receiver distance of {\~{}}15,800 km. We believe this to be the furthest documented range of a naturally occurring underwater signal above 1 Hz.

abstract = {The Bragg scattering of random, non-stationary surface gravity waves by random topography on a gently sloping bottom is investigated. A correction is given of previously published expressions for the triad wave{\{}wave{\{}bottom interaction source term in the spectral energy balance equation, and the result is reconciled with deterministic theories for the reflection of waves from sinusoidal seabed undulations. For both normal and oblique incidence, the stochastic and deterministic theories are equivalent in the limit of long propagation distances. Even for relatively short distances (for example two bottom undulations), the reflected energy predicted by the stochastic source term formulation is generally within 15{\%} of values predicted by deterministic theories. The detuning of Bragg resonance by refraction and shoaling is discussed, suggesting practical validity conditions for the stochastic theory. The e ect of bottom scattering on swell propagation is illustrated with numerical model computations for the North Carolina continental shelf using high-resolution bathymetry and an ecient semi-implicit scheme to evaluate the bottom scattering source term and integrate the energy balance equation. Model results demonstrate the importance of forward scattering of waves that propagate at large oblique angles over bottom features with typical scales of one to several surface wavelengths. This process contributes signi cantly to the directional spread of swell on the continental shelf by di using energy, in the spectrum, around the mean wave direction. Back-scattering, caused by bottom features with crests parallel to those of the surface waves and wavelengths close to half the surface wavelength, is weak, owing to the sharp roll-o of the bottom elevation spectrum at high wavenumbers. Model predictions are consistent with eld measurements.}}},

abstract = {In Alaska, where many active volcanoes exist without ground-based instrumentation, the use of techniques suitable for distant monitoring is pivotal. In this study we report regional-scale seismic and infrasound observations of volcanic activity at Mt. Cleveland between December 2011 and August 2012. During this period, twenty explosions were detected by infrasound sensors as far away as 1827 km from the active vent, and ground-coupled acoustic waves were recorded at seismic stations across the Aleutian Arc. Several events resulting from the explosive disruption of small lava domes within the summit crater were confirmed by analysis of satellite remote sensing data. However, many explosions eluded initial, automated, analyses of satellite data due to poor weather conditions. Infrasound and seismic monitoring provided effective means for detecting these hidden events. We present results from the implementation of automatic infrasound and seismo-acoustic eruption detection algorithms, and review the challenges of real-time volcano monitoring operations in remote regions. We also model acoustic propagation in the Northern Pacific, showing how tropospheric ducting effects allow infrasound to travel long distances across the Aleutian Arc. The successful results of our investigation provide motivation for expanded efforts in infrasound monitoring across the Aleutians and contributes to our knowledge of the number and style of vulcanian eruptions at Mt. Cleveland.},

abstract = {The importance of moisture feedback between continental precipitation and evaporation, referred to as moisture recycling, is still under debate. Most of the research in the past focused on the contribution of recycling to precipitation within a certain region only. This paper clearly distinguishes between different definitions of moisture recycling. This allows us to study the complete process of continental moisture recycling. In addition to identifying how much of the precipitation originates from continental sources, a new definition is used to identify regions which are major moisture suppliers for continental precipitation. An accounting procedure based on ERA‐40 reanalysis data is used to calculate moisture recycling ratios. As such, this paper derives new information from existing data. It is estimated that on average 38 {\%} of the continental precipitation has continental origin and that 52 {\%} of the continental evaporation returns as precipitation over continents. This paper demonstrates the important role of topography in the Andes and the Tibetan Plateau where regional moisture recycling is a key process. The Amazon and the Congo are identified as very important regions for sustaining continental precipitation. It is also demonstrated that moisture recycling from the Eurasian continent is the major supplier of the fresh water resources of China.},

abstract = {Infrasound from the eruptions of Mt. Etna was detected in The Netherlands at the Deelen Infrasound Array (DIA) during the summer of 2001. Zonal cross winds lead to a deviation in the observed back azimuth. An average azimuthal deviation of 2.6° is explained by westward stratospheric winds along the infrasonic trajectories through the atmosphere. The signals have signal-to-noise power ratios lower than 0.6. The detectability of Mt. Etna's infrasound is tested on sub-arrays of the 13 elements of DIA. Doing so, sparse arrays used in the International Monitoring System (IMS) are mimicked. Both small aperture sub-arrays of 800 m and large aperture sub-arrays of 1400 m are applied. The results are evaluated on the basis of the number of detections made. The number of detections strongly increases with the number of elements. Small aperture sub-arrays perform significantly better than large aperture sub-arrays. With a factor of two reduction in the aperture, two instruments less can be used to obtain the same number of detections. Larger aperture arrays perform less well because of the loss of spatial coherence of the infrasound. The average accuracy of the detections slightly increased, when the number of elements is increased. The result of the use of more elements is that lower signal-to-noise power ratio events could be detected. The trade-off between more detections and the larger average deviation in back azimuth and apparent sound speed causes the slight increase accuracy. The results were comparable to the detections obtained at IMS array IS26 in Germany. It is concluded that successfully applying infrasound as monitoring technique strongly depends on the array configuration. The frequency versus spatial coherence of signals will play a decisive role in detecting low signal-to-noise ratio events. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A theory is presented that describes the scattering of random surface gravity waves by small-amplitude topography, with horizontal scales of the order of the wavelength, in the presence of an irrotational and almost uniform current. A perturbation expansion of the wave action to order $\eta$2 yields an evolution equation for the wave action spectrum, where $\eta$ = max(h)/H is the small-scale bottom amplitude normalized by the mean water depth. Spectral wave evolution is proportional to the bottom elevation variance at the resonant wavenumbers, representing a Bragg scattering approximation. With a current, scattering results from a direct effect of the bottom topography, and an indirect effect of the bottom through the modulations of the surface current and mean surface elevation. For Froude numbers of the order of 0.6 or less, the bottom topography effects dominate. For all Froude numbers, the reflection coefficients for the wave amplitudes that are inferred from the wave action source term are asymptotically identical, as $\eta$ goes to zero, to previous theoretical results for monochromatic waves propagating in one dimension over sinusoidal bars. In particular, the frequency of the most reflected wave components is shifted by the current, and wave action conservation results in amplified reflected wave energies for following currents. Application of the theory to waves over current-generated sandwaves suggests that forward scattering can be significant, resulting in a broadening of the directional wave spectrum, while back-scattering should be generally weaker.},

Here, it is shown that diffraction effects can lead to a dramatic increase in the transparency of gas-solid interfaces at low frequencies, resulting in the bulk of energy emitted by compact sources within a solid being radiated into a gas. The anomalous transparency is made possible by power fluxes in evanescent body waves and by excitation of interface waves.

abstract = {Sound waves traveling through the atmosphere, with frequencies below the human hearing threshold, are referred to as infrasound. In general, periods of 500 seconds up to frequencies of 20 Hz are considered to be infrasound. Much interest arose for infrasound when it became one of the veriﬁcation means of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). The study of infra- sound has also proved to be applicable in studies of the atmosphere, i.e. as atmospheric probe. The measurements of infrasound are often hampered by a background of strong pressure ﬂuctuations, due to turbulent wind. Therefore high quality detectors are required. For the detection of infrasound signals, two algorithms are widely used, Fisher ratio analysis and the Progressive Multi Channel Correlation method (PMCC). Despite their extensive usage it is still unknown how both algorithms compare to each other. The performance of the detector is important because it deter- mines the success of infrasound as monitoring technique. In this study both detection algorithms are studied mathematically and exper- imentally. Many diﬀerent types of synthetic data are sifted through in order to obtain an overview of the accuracy and detection limits of the algorithms. Furthermore real infrasound data is analyzed as validation of the results ob- tained from the synthetic data. From the results obtained from the synthetic and real data, Fisher proved to be able to perform a signiﬁcant better signal search. Fisher showed small errors in azimuth and apparent velocity close to a signal-to-noise power of 0.05. PMCC showed larger errors in azimuth and apparent velocity, and the transition to complete failure was close to a signal-to-noise power of 0.2.},

abstract = {In seismology and ocean acoustics, the interface with the atmosphere is typically represented as a free surface. Similarly, these interfaces are considered as a rigid surface for infrasound propagation. This implies that seismic or acoustic waves are not transmitted into the atmosphere from subsurface sources, and vice versa. Nevertheless, infrasound generated by subsurface sources has been observed. In this work, seismo-acoustic modeling of infrasound propagation from underwater and underground sources will be presented. The fast field program (FFP) is used to model the seismo-acoustic coupling between the solid earth, the ocean, and the atmosphere under the variation of source and media parameters. The FFP model allows for a detailed analysis of the seismo-acoustic coupling mechanisms in frequency-wavenumber space. A thorough analysis of the coupling mechanisms reveals that evanescent wave coupling and leaky surface waves are the main energy contributors to long-range infrasound propagation. Moreover, it is found that source depth affects the relative amplitude of the tropospheric and stratospheric phases, which allows for source depth estimation in the future.},

The main breakthrough is to achieve very efficient on-the-fly computations of the Legendre associated functions, even for very high resolutions, by taking advantage of the specific properties of the SHT and the advanced capabilities of current and future computers. This allows us to simultaneously and significantly reduce memory usage and computation time of the SHT. We measure the performance and accuracy of our algorithms. Even though the complexity of the algorithms implemented in SHTns are in {\$}O(N{\^{}}3){\$} (where N is the maximum harmonic degree of the transform), they perform much better than any third party implementation, including lower complexity algorithms, even for truncations as high as N=1023.

abstract = {In this study we analyze infrasound signals from three earthquakes in central Italy. The Mw 6.0 Amatrice, Mw 5.9 Visso, and Mw 6.5 Norcia earthquakes generated significant epicentral ground motions that couple to the atmosphere and produce infrasonic waves. Epicentral seismic and infrasonic signals are detected at I26DE; however, a third type of signal, which arrives after the seismic wave train and before the epicentral infrasound signal, is also detected. This peculiar signal propagates across the array at acoustic wave speeds, but the celerity associated with it is 3 times the speed of sound. Atmosphere-independent backprojections and full 3-D ray tracing using atmospheric conditions of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts are used to demonstrate that this apparently fast-arriving infrasound signal originates from ground motions more than 400 km away from the epicenter. The location of the secondary infrasound patch coincides with the closest bounce point to I26DE as depicted by ray tracing backprojections.},

abstract = {The acoustic ray tracing relations are extended by the inclusion of auxiliary parameters describing variations in the spatial ray coordinates and eikonal vector due to changes in the initial conditions. Computation of these parameters allows one to define the geometric spreading factor along individual ray paths and assists in identification of caustic surfaces so that phase shifts can be easily identified. A method is developed leveraging the auxiliary parameters to identify propagation paths connecting specific source-receiver geometries, termed eigenrays. The newly introduced method is found to be highly efficient in cases where propagation is non-planar due to horizontal variations in the propagation medium or the presence of cross winds. The eigenray method is utilized in analysis of infrasonic signals produced by a multi-stage sounding rocket launch with promising results for applications of tracking aeroacoustic sources in the atmosphere and specifically to analysis of motor performance during dynamic tests.},

@article{Neele1991,
abstract = {b Data from two broad-band arrays in western Europe (NARS and GRF) are used to study the character of long-period body wave coda. The events studied are at epicentral distances of 40d̀ to 60d̀, in the Hindu Kush region and on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, sampling the upper mantle to a depth of about 1000 km. The periods studied are 5-50 s. The long-period coda of P at GRF (interstation distance about 10 km) are strongly coherent, whereas the long-period coda of PP-, PPP- and S-waves are incoherent. This indicates that the latter coda consists of scattered waves. To investigate the nature of the scattering process, the data of GRF are analysed for slowness and azimuth variations in the coda intervals. A new beamforming algorithm is presented to deal with the low frequences and relatively short time intervals. The method is based on Backus-Gilbert inverse theory. The results show that the incoherent long-period coda intervals almost entirely consist of surface waves; these waves are scattered from the preceding body waves. Some calculations with linearized theory for body wave to Rayleigh wave conversion at topography at the surface or at the Moho show that realistic scatterers can account for the observed (constant) coda level. The beamforming results show that the phases in the P coda all arrive along the great circle. As scattering calculations point out that body wave to body wave scattering is inefficient, it is concluded that the long-period P coda does not contain a significant amount of scattered energy. Synthetic seismo-grams obtained with the reflectivity method show that spherically symmetric upper mantle models can explain these coda waves. For events in the Hindu Kush region, an upper mantle with a thick lid overlying a pronounced low-velocity zone (LVZ) is necessary to explain the character of the P coda at GRF. Such an upper mantle agrees with previous studies of similar great circle paths. The strong coherence of the P coda at GRF is lost on the scale of NARS (station separation about 200 km). This suggests lateral variations in the upper mantle at a scale of about 200 km. It appears from previous studies of the upper mantle under Europe that these variations must be sought in the LVZ. It is shown that the long-period P coda is sensitive to variations in the P velocity structure of the LVZ. This suggests the P coda (i.e. PdP phases) as a tool for monitoring lateral variations in the LVZ and possibly to prove the existence or absence of a LVZ in the P velocity.},

@article{Ardhuin2011,
abstract = {Noise with periods 3 to 10 s, ubiquitous in seismic records, is expected to be mostly generated by pairs of ocean wave trains of opposing propagation directions with half the seismic frequency. Here we present the first comprehensive numerical model of microseismic generation by random ocean waves, including ocean wave reflections. Synthetic and observed seismic spectra are well correlated (r {\textgreater} 0.85). On the basis of the model results, noise generation events can be clustered in three broad classes: wind waves with a broad directional spectrum (class I), sea states with a significant contribution of coastal reflections (class II), and the interaction of two independent wave systems (class III). At seismic stations close to western coasts, noise generated by class II sources generally dominates, but it is intermittently outshined by the intense class III sources, limiting the reliability of seismic data as a proxy for storm climates. The modeled seismic noise critically depends on the damping of seismic waves. At some mid-ocean island stations, low seismic damping is necessary to reproduce the observed high level and smoothness of noise time series that result from a spatial integration of sources over thousands of kilometers. In contrast, some coastal stations are only sensitive to noise within a few hundreds of kilometers. This revelation of noise source patterns worldwide provides a wealth of information for seismic studies, wave climate applications, and new constraints on the possible directional distribution of wave energy.},

abstract = {Radiosonde data show a large seasonal difference in trends since 1979 in the tropical lower stratosphere, with a maximum cooling of similar to 1 K decade(-1) in December and January and a minimum in March or April at 50 mb between 10 degrees N and 10 degrees S. The statistically significant difference of up to similar to 1 K decade(-1) between trends in December and those in March amounts to up to 20{\%} of the climatological seasonal cycle. Although the size of annual mean cooling trends differs substantially among datasets, the seasonal pattern of trends is similar in all six radiosonde datasets used here and is consistent with MSU satellite data for the lower stratosphere. This greater cooling in boreal winter essentially disappears below 100 mb, and the troposphere has a different and smaller seasonal trend pattern. Trends in the tropical stratosphere show an inverse relationship with those in the Arctic for 1979-2009, which might be related to changes in stratospheric circulation. In most radiosonde data, however, the seasonal pattern of tropical trends at 50 mb since 1979 seems to come from a seasonal difference in the size of the stratospheric cooling in the mid-1990s, and trends for longer time periods or those for 1995-2009 do not show the same seasonal dependence. Whether the strengthening of the seasonal cycle in the stratosphere represents a long-term change related to greenhouse gas forcing, a shorter-lived shift related to ozone depletion or unforced interdecadal variability requires careful further study.},

The uncertainty of the system has been determined combining the statistical effects of input parameters uncertainty under the basic hypothesis that the sound source can be represented as a distribution of independent monopoles. This analysis was performed using a Type B approach based on an analytical model according to the ISO Guide of the expression of uncertainty in measurement and subsequently using a numerical model based on Monte Carlo simulation. Systematic errors due to deviations of input parameters (e.g. speed of sound or source–array distance), affecting output level and spatial accuracy have been analysed. Once these inaccuracies were quantified, suggestions to minimize them were given. Finally a criterion to optimize focussing of the beamforming technique based on acoustic image contrast maximization has been developed.},

abstract = {— This paper describes an automatic and interactive data processing system designed to locate impulsive atmospheric sources with a yield of at least one kiloton by detecting and characterizing the airborne infrasound radiated by the source. The infrasonic processing subsystem forms part of a larger system currently under development at the Prototype International Data Center (PIDC) in Arlington, Virginia where seismic, hydroacoustic, radionuclide and infrasonic methods are used to detect and locate impulsive sources in any terrestrial environment. Infrasonic signal detection is achieved via a coincidence detector which requires both the normalized cross correlation and the short-term-average/long-term-average ratio of a beam in the direction of maximum correlation to exceed predetermined threshold values simultaneously before a detection is declared. The infrasound propagation model currently used to infer travel-time information assumes the horizontal sound speed across the ground to be 320.0 m/s. This crude model is currently being replaced by a model which predicts travel-time information through a ray-tracing algorithm for acoustic waves in an atmosphere with seasonal representations for temperature and wind. A novel feature of the source location process is the fusion of all available arrival information, whether it be seismic, hydroacoustic or infrasonic to locate a single source where it is reasonable to hypothesize a common source. In its final configuration the infrasonic subsystem will routinely process data from the global 60-station International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasonic network currently under development.},

abstract = {Acoustics play a central role in mankind's interactions with the ocean and the life within. Passive listening to ocean "soundscapes" informs us about the physical and bio-acoustic environment from earthquakes to communication between fish. Active acoustic probing of the environment informs us about ocean topography, currents and temperature, and abundance and type of marine life vital to fisheries and biodiversity related interests. The two together in a multi-purpose network can lead to discovery and improve understanding of ocean ecosystem health and biodiversity, climate variability and change, and marine hazards and maritime safety. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of sound generated and utilized by marine life as well as other natural (wind, rain, ice, seismics) and anthropogenic (shipping, surveys) sources, has dramatically increased worldwide to enhance understanding of ecological processes. Characterizing ocean soundscapes (the levels and frequency of sound over time and space, and the sources contributing to the sound field), temporal trends in ocean sound at different frequencies, distribution and abundance of marine species that vocalize, and distribution and amount of human activities that generate sound in the sea, all require passive acoustic systems. Acoustic receivers are now routinely acquiring data on a global scale, e.g., Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization International Monitoring System hydroacoustic arrays, various regional integrated ocean observing systems, and some profiling floats. Judiciously-placed low-frequency acoustic sources transmitting to globally distributed PAM and other systems provide: 1) high temporal resolution measurements of large-scale ocean temperature/heat content variability, taking advantage of the inherent integrating nature of acoustic travel-time data using tomography; and 2) acoustic positioning ("underwater GPS") and communication services enabling basin-scale undersea navigation and management of floats, gliders, and AUVs. This will be especially valuable in polar regions with ice cover. Routine deployment of sources during repeat global-scale hydrographic ship surveys would provide high spatial coverage snapshots of ocean temperatures. To fully exploit the PAM systems, precise timing and positioning need to be broadly implemented. Ocean sound is now a mature Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) "essential ocean variable", which is one crucial step toward providing a fully integrated global multi-purpose ocean acoustic observing system.},
